Please feel free to email us at [events@igdatc.org](mailto:events@igdatc.org), especially if you are interested in speaking at one of our meetings.


**MSP GameDev Slack**

There is an active slack channel where IGDA Twin Cities members hang out and chat virtually every day. If you want to discuss IGDA Twin Cities specifically, please join the #igdatc-meta channel!

You can [request an invite to the MSP GameDev Slack](https://mspgamedevslack.herokuapp.com/) if you don't have an account, or [enter the MSP GameDev Slack](https://mspgamedev.slack.com/) if you already have one.


**Twitch**

When our events are online, you can watch them in realtime on [twitch.tv/igdatc](https://twitch.tv/igdatc). They are then archived on [the igdatc youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24qSwLgzJU3D1dXNg8ZX-Q).


**Discord**

If slack is not your thing, but Discord is, there is a [Twin Cities Gamedev Discord](https://discord.gg/Q4uqaZe), as well as [an IGDA Twin Cities channel in the IGDA Discord](https://discord.gg/5gkpJRm).


**IGDA Parent Organization**

If you are already (or want to become) a member of the IGDA, please head over to [https://igda.org/chapters/us-mn-twin-cities/](https://igda.org/chapters/us-mn-twin-cities/) to find us there.

**Mailing List Archives**

In the past, the IGDA Twin Cities has maintained a mailing list, which eventually we migrated to [a google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/igda-tc). You can still view the google group posts, but both have been disabled in favor of the communication methods above.
