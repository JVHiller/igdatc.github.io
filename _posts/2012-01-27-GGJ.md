Friday, January 27, 2012 at 4:30 PM - Sunday, January 29, 2012 at 4:00 PM

We are confirmed open all 48 hours! Thanks once again to the Nerdery for being great and flexible hosts!

####  Schedule

Fri
* 4:30pm: setup
* ~5pm: receive assignment, watch 30min keynote video, Q&A, eat pizza - thanks Nerdery!
* ~6pm: introduction and pitches, team formation.

Sat
* mid-day: Each team should register their game/project on this site.

Sun
* 3pm stop work and begin upload (must complete before 5pm.)
* ~3:30pm: We will demo games to each other, quick logistics brainstorm for our 2/8 IGDATC GGJ Play Party, and pack up.

Yep, it's that simple.


#### Joysticks/gamepads and other

Bring joysticks/gamepads if you have them. Many game types suck on keyboard. Recommendations: Xbox 360 wired, PS3 wired/bluetooth, Xbox 360 wireless (need wireless dongle.)

iOS devices will probably get used, see Brass Monkey in the software promos.
Other (Kinect, Move, webcam, dance pads, etc.) If you can pitch it, bring it. You only have to convince 1 or 2 other people. It will limit who can play, but it could also make your title stand out from the expected 2000 games!


#### Facilities

We're based in the classromm, but can wander in the lunch area and Nerditorium (after the movie finishes 9pm Fri.)
We have chairs, desks, tables, beanbags, whiteboards, projetor, etc. A dedicated subnet and WAP to ensure we can test peer to peer net code.

Please bring a power strip if you have one. Also, ethernet cables if you need/want it. Speakers, any other weird misc things you can think of.


#### Food

Full kitchen with microwaves, sinks, fridges available. Snacks, soda and coffee onsite. Bring cash in small bills if you want to do group food buys (eg bring in bagles in am.)
