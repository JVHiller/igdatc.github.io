#### UW-Stout VR Collaboration with Jim Henson Company

Students from the University of Wisconsin-Stoutâ€™s Game Design BFA will present projects resulting from collaboration with the Jim Henson Company to create games inspired by the Farscape Universe. Two teams of eight used Maya and Unity to create 3D environments to be experienced with the Oculus Rift DK2 headsets. After working for two intense weeks, the 16 students flew out to Los Angeles to pitch their projects to the Jim Henson Company, and tour various game and animation studios. The presentation will both serve as a pitch for the game, as well as a play test session with the VR headsets.


#### Exploring networking games with different tools
##### Vernon Alatorre

Moderately technical with a little bit of how to and some live demos, this presentation is about the experience learning and using some networking tools (Atavism/photon/Unity) and the pros and cons of each. Helpful tips and information about tools, technology and software.
