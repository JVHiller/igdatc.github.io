#### Holiday Game Party!

_[Watch on Youtube](https://youtu.be/OjtXe0FwuqI)_


Question: What's more fun than making games?

Answer: Playing games with your game dev friends, new and old!

This month, to celebrate another year of great game dev talks, we'll be meeting online to socialize and play some games. We'll play Jackbox, Glom, CULTivate, Codenames and maybe a few surprises along the way.

We'll be live on [youtube.com/igdatc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjtXe0FwuqI), Wednesday the 8th at 6:30.

Follow us [@igdatc](https://twitter.com/igdatc) for more details!
