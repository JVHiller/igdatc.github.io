ARKit 2 debuted at the Apple WWDC in early June, with a large number of new features and improvements. We started experimenting right away, and can share early thoughts on how these might work in practice for multi-user AR, environment integration, permanent virtual state, etc.

ARKit 2 added:

 - Saving and reloading spatial maps
 - Sharing spatial maps across devices
 - Environment texturing/capture
 - 3D Object detection and tracking
 - USDZ 3D File format and AR Quick Look app
 - Face and gaze tracking improvements
 - 2D Image tracking improvements
