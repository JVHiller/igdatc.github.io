#### Global Game Jam Recap and Game Post-mortems

Global Game Jam Recap and Game Post-mortems

GameCraft, the Global Game Jam 2016, was a smashing success with 31 games submitted on our jam site. With the 2016 Global Gam Jam still fresh in our minds, come join us for a review discussion and post-mortems. Some teams will talk about their game and their jam expereince. What went wrong, what went right? Learned lessons and fun happenings. A great way to recap the Global Game Jam and see what eveyone spent their 48 hours on.

If you participated in the jam and would like to talk about your game during the meeting, please register for the "I'll talk about my game" ticket.

Due to the number of games and limited time and space, this is not a play event.
