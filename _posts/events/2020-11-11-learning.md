##### Ellen Burns-Johnson

The buzz around game-based learning experiences (also called educational games and "serious" games) is getting noticeably louder. Games are showing up in physical and virtual classrooms of all sorts: not just in K-12, but also in government and corporate training, nonprofits, healthcare, and higher education. It's an added challenge to make a game with authentic learning at its core. In this talk, Ellen Burns-Johnson will go over some techniques for creating compelling games for learning.

  * Analyze the learning aspects of different popular games
  * Align game design to learning outcomes
  * Brainstorm some ideas for a learning game
  * Learn to think "outside the quiz"

Ellen Burns-Johnson is an award winning learning experience designer (LXD) and consultant with more than a decade of experience in the education and training industries. She was a level designer and "explosion czar" on [Widget Satchel](http://noblerobot.com/widget-satchel) and a designer/producer on [Dicer and Clasp: Dungeon Skedaddle!](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/dicer-and-clasp-dungeon-skedaddle) for GGJ 2018. Ellen is also one of the three permanent hosts on the [Nice Games Club](http://nicegames.club/) weekly podcast. Ellen lives in Saint Paul with her husband and two dogs. She is terrible at racing games, always picks the sniper build, and loves a good puzzle/platformer.
