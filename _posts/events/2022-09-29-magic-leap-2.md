#### Magic Leap 2 Early Look
##### Bradley Elenbass

Magic Leap 2 has an official release on 9/30, and is currently in early access. The hardware is solid, but there is no app store, or anything else for that matter. The documentation is filled with placeholder text. Unreal support is still missing. The demo app isnâ€™t fully functional. ADB is having trouble. Zero Iteration crashes often.

So come see it and be amazed at the future! See the real world segmented dimming! See hand tracking and the new controller with cameras on-board! See the increased FOV! See the non-existent C API documentation!

My talk will give an overview of Magic Leap 2, and the changes since Magic Leap 1. I'll touch on all the new features, and go in-depth on the ones I've had a chance to try.

We'll have a demo app on ML2 for those who just want to see the new hardware, and a ML1 with more content. Glasses do not fit - wear contacts if you have them!
