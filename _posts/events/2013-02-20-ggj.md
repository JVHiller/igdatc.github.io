#### Global Game Jam 2013 Recap and Projects

A quick overview of GGJ 2013.  Then, even quicker presentations from IGDATC teams: showing their project, any post-jam improvements, war stories, and any lessons learned.

The 2013 GGJ was a 48-hour game jam that took place worldwide the weekend of 1/25, with 38 countries and over 16,000 people participating.  The Nerdery once again generously hosted the IGDATC site.  We had 35 people spend the weekend making 14 different game projects.

The GGJ server buckled under the load, but most of our projects are here, in end-of-jam state.
