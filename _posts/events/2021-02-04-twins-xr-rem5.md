##### REM5 Studios


Tour Twins XR with [REM5 STUDIOS](https://www.rem5studios.com/) and see how they created this big-league experience. You can enter this experience on mobile, desktop/laptop, Oculus Quest, or PC VR.

REM5 STUDIOS has spent the past few months creating a virtual hall of fame experience for the Major League Baseball team the Minnesota Twins. Our goal is to not only replace a canceled physical event, but to build a social platform for fans for years to come. We're looking to have thousands of fans through the experience in a two-week time period.
