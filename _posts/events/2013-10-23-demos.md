#### Oculus Rift demos from VR Jam

There is a great new generation of VR games thanks to the [VR Jam](http://www.oculusvr.com/vrjam/), and ongoing community work.

Expect to do 5-10 ~5 minute sessions, and have a little vertigo inbetween. Wear contacts if you have them, everyone last time said it also works fine with no correction/glasses.

We'll also have a couple non-Rift demos that use unique forms of input.


Kickoff is 7pm in the auditorium.  Setup is in the Nerdery classroom, lunchroom AND auditorium. (Hefty A/C, props and saftey bean bags to play [Hydra Cover Shooter](https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=2915))


* *Rift Bringers* - Bring an extension cord, lens cloth, and a Hydra if you have it.  We'd love to show your work!  Demos of other HCI hardware also welcome (Leap, Depth Cam, other HMDs, etc.)

* *Demo Minders* - Lend a hand if you're good with PC/Mac video card / multimon, so that the nice folks sharing their hardware get to try everything.  We'll make sure you do too.  Arrive by 6:30 for setup.

* *E-mail list* - We're likely to "sell out" again.  But we will notify you of any cancelations, and future events.
