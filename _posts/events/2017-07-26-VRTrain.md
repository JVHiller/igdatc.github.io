#### Chaos on the Green Line

Chaos on the Green Line debuted at the all-night Northern Spark event on June 10th. This first iteration is a pair of VR experiences that can be viewed while riding the METRO Green Line train between Snelling and Lexington. The project was large colaboration between Motionpoems, Pixel Farm, Egg Music, Patrick Swinnea, Martin Grider and Steve Sutherland.

Creating VR experiences for viewing on a train ride involved many unique challenges around content design, viewer comfort, software, testing, logistics and planning.

Grab the Chaos on the Green Line app for Android or iOS, and try it in VR or hand-held 360 on your next Green Line ride, or at our meeting with a secret code. We'll have a split presentation to cover both technical details and content, art and design.
