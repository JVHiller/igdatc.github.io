#### Chaos on the Green Line

[Chaos on the Green Line](https://2017.northernspark.org/projects/chaos-green-line/) debuted at the all-night Northern Spark event on June 10th. This first iteration is a pair of VR experiences that can be viewed while riding the METRO Green Line train between Snelling and Lexington. The project was large colaboration between [Motionpoems](http://motionpoems.org/), [Pixel Farm](http://www.pixelfarm.com/), [Egg Music](http://www.egg-music.com/), [Patrick Swinnea](http://www.peacockgames.com/), [Martin Grider](http://www.abstractpuzzle.com/) and [Steve Sutherland](https://www.wearemanufacture.com/).

Creating VR experiences for viewing on a train ride involved many unique challenges around content design, viewer comfort, software, testing, logistics and planning.

Grab the Chaos on the Green Line app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motionpoems.chaos) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chaos-on-the-green-line/id1239596853), and try it in VR or hand-held 360 on your next Green Line ride, or at our meeting with a secret code. We'll have a split presentation to cover both technical details and content, art and design.
