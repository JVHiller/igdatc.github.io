#### Free to Play Coulds and Shoulds
##### [Ben Sipe](http://freemiumdesign.blogspot.com/)

Game & Monetization Consultant Ben Sipe will be talking about challenging decisions developers face when designing their games. Some of the topics covered will include...

* Scenarios where Premium can be better than Freemium
* Monetization mechanics and ways to tweak your game to optimize performance
* F2P tactics, and which are becoming less acceptable
* Meta games vs. end games and how F2P mechanics differs with them
* We hope that you'll walk away from this session with new ideas around the F2P business model on how to monetize in your future games.
