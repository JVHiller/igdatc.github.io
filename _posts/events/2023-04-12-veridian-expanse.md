##### Scott Lembke

"Drill, craft, and blast your way through winding caverns." Veridian Expanse is the game Scott wanted to make for years, but never felt like the time was right. Covid 19 compounded with a bit of burnout changed the equation for him.

Scott Lembcke delves into the development of Veridian Expanse, from it's prototype to it's design and implementation. You'll also learn about crafting a custom game "engine" by composing it out of existing libraries and tools, and why a person might want to.

An advocate for open source in game development for over 2 decades, Scott has workd on many projects including the Chipmunk2D physics library, and the Cocos2D game framework. He's also worked in game adjacent fields such as real-time drone mapping, 3D math for heavy machines, and biosignal analysis for VR healthcare applications.
