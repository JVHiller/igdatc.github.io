#### Listen to your game: Design through Playtesting
##### Eric Mickols

My talk will be on preparing for and running a successful playtesting session for a multiplayer game. I'll be using examples from a tabletop RPG I am working on, Guilds of Torhal. I'll be covering playtest goals, types of players to invite, and how to get useful feedback from them.

I'll also give an overview of the Gencon event and what it was like to speak there. Extra detail on the GenCon playtesting hall, the Dungeons and Dragons Next design discussions, and some discussion about event-only gameplay, like True Dungeon and Artemis.
