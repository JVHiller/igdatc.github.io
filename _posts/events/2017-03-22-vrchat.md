#### [VRChat](http://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/) - presented by Brightstone VC

VRChat is a virtual reality social platform that allows users to easily build social virtual reality content. Any virtual world built with the VRChat platform instantly becomes a social VR world. This means VRChat users can explore and play in these worlds together, in a social setting. VRChat is also a great sandbox for VR Devs with existing content and projects.

Seth DeGroot will give us an introduction to VRChat and demonstrate the tools pipeline to get content online. If you want to try it here's two great step-by-step tutorials for [avatars](https://youtu.be/SAVswPdB64Q), and [environments](https://youtu.be/Ebcoed-K4i0).

Shane Huston, MN's wayward son, will share a VR developers perspective bringing existing content into VRChat for the first time. He'll be attempting to do this from inside VRChat while inhabiting the giant brontosaurus model from his current project.

Graham Gaylor and Jesse Joudrey (the founders of VRChat) will be answering questions as we go, and wrap up the presentations with a final Q&A.
