####  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Metaverses - Carlos Austin, Copeland Williams
##### Carlos Austin and Cope Williams

Carlos Austin and Cope Williams have spent thousands of hours in shared online VR - attending conferences, concerts, shows, filming, volunteering, gaming, creating, and just socializing.  Their presentation covers 15 of the most interesting and important of these metaverses.  They will cover each platform's unique strengths, weaknesses, target audience, and their favorite experiences there.

We pitched an eye tracking controlled wheelchair at the [DMC Assistive Tech Challenge](https://dmc.mn/assistive-tech-challenge/). We'll share an overview of the event, and a quick post-mortem of our functional prototype that used Magic Leap.
