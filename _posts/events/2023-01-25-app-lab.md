App Lab is the wild west, new frontier space of the VR world right now. If you have something you want to show the world, it's the best place to put it. But what about all the steps to get there? It can seem daunting at first, and almost surprising how difficult it can be considering some of the content you may have seen on there. But it's actually fairly simple! In this talk, I'll go over:

* Project setup, concept, things to keep in mind
* Meta's VRCs, certain requirements your app has to meet to be allowed
* Marketing. App Lab listings are not visible on the store without directly searching for it, but there's plenty of other ways...
* Community management. How to wrangle and get along with the players that your game attracts

Me and firestorm are going to discuss about who we are and how we met in person. We will also discuss about the discord we created together and the events that we have attended to together and our goals for what we want in the future as individuals. Once we do introductions and who we are and what our goals are then we will proceed to talking about LANFest . LANFest will be our main topic on how we both got started in the charity event and what its like to be a staff member and also what its like to run the whole Minnesota LANFest chapter as chapter admin! Once we go into details about that we will end our conversation there about where we see ourselves in 5 years from now with LANFest .
