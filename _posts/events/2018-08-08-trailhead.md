##### Joe Schaeppi

This talk will focus on the importance of understanding your players beyond behavior and the risks of armchair psychology. A deep psychological understanding of your players and your game's ability to reflect as well as engage a gamer's feelings and psychological needs is the key to unlocking high quality installs while creating long term, sustainable, engagement that's healthy for both gamers and game developers.
