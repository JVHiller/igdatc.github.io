#### A Homebrew Data Glove with Haptic Feedback on a Budget
##### Paul Christian

While I was anxiously waiting for my DK1 to ship, all I could think about were ways to do things in VR. Game controllers are great, but I wanted hands. So having a bit of electronics knowledge and being a decent programmer, I figured might as well try to build a data glove.

This will be a brief presentation of what went into making it, some things learned in the process, applications, limitations and future plans; followed by a hands-on demo if time allows. I'll also do an overview of features vs complexity and cost in commercial gloves/trackers.


Paul Christian is a full-stack JVM web developer/artist/musician, and recent transplant from Philadelphia. Interested in collaboration or employment relating to VR, physical computing, HCI R&D, edutainment, etc.
