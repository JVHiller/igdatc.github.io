This month's meeting will be virtually hosted at the WALLRIDE Warehouse.  This is a Mozilla Hubs environment, so you can attend in a modern browser on [mobile, Mac, PC, PC VR, or Oculus Quest.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/which-devices-can-i-use-join-hubs-room).

#### Workflow and Design for Mozilla Hubs and Quest Hand Tracking experiences
##### [WALLRIDE Games](https://www.wallridegames.com/)

We recently made the WALLRIDE Warehouse as a fun environment for virtual discussions, and just to hang out while working remotely.  We'll give you a tour, and discuss the optimizations and Unity workflow tips we learned along the way - that apply to any Mozilla Hubs environment.

WALLRIDE also recently released a hand tracking demo for Quest.  We'll talk about what works, and what doesn't with current hand tracking, and where we think it's safe to use without risk of user frustration.
