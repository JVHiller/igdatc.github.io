#### VR/HCI project postmortems from GameCraft / Global Game Jam

Global Game Jam 2016 was another huge success. Thanks to Glitch and all the voulenteers that made the local GameCraft site run so smoothly with almost 150 participants. There were 6 projects this year that used VR, mixed reality, or some unusual form of HCI:

* [Aztec Pong](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/aztec-pong)
* [Crossbow Defender](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/crossbow-defender)
* [Dark Mazes and Face Lasers](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/dark-mazes-and-face-lasers)
* [Save Jimmy!](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/save-jimmy-vr)
* [Tiki Terror](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/tiki-terror)
* [VR Wood Chipper, Oops!](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/vr-wood-chipper-oops-oculus-rift-dk2-razer-hydra-or-perception-neuron-and-paint-brush)

We'll have 5-minute post mortems from each team, and focus the rest of the time on mingling and demos. Show up on the early side if you want to be sure to try everything. And, feel free to bring your own portable project if you like.
