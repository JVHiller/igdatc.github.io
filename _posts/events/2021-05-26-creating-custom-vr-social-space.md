#### Creating a Custom VR Social Space

##### Matt Summers, [Pixel Farm](https://www.pixelfarm.com/)

Creating your own VR social  app lets you add  totally unique custom features, and bypass the security hurdles needed in a public social space.  Getting started with Normcore networking in Unity can be quick, and their free tier works fine until you need to scale up.

As an experiment, we'd like to get a large group inside Matt's Quest app during the presentation.  We sent out app invites to your Eventbrite email Tue night.
