IGDA Twin Cities is once again hosting an all day E3 social event at the Chatterbox Pub.  Stop by for lunch, dinner, drinks.  Or, hang out and "work".  Zach and Ryan will be there all day, hacking on Unity, openFrameworks and Processing, and probably mostly playing MAME on the arcade controls and [Saprobiont](http://globalgamejam.org/2012/saprobiont).

Bring fun card games or 3DS (please) or whatever, and an extension cord if you're serious about the laptop/work.   We'll be in the banquet room from 11am - 10pm, and maybe later  Guests and strangers encouraged!.

We've upgraded to a video feed on the main projector this year (except for Ubisoft.)  Keynote schedule and home viewing options (if you hate fun.)
