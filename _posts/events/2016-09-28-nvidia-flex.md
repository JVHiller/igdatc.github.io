#### Nvidia Flex and Flow for VR
##### [Paul Eckhardt](http://bricklightstudios.com/motioncontrol/)

Paul did a quick Nvidia Flex VR prototype for our October social/demo event. It had a really unique feel, and generated a lot of discussion and questions afterwards. If you missed his demo, you can check out Flex in [NVidia VR Funhouse](http://store.steampowered.com/app/468700/) for Vive.

This month, Paul's going to get us all up to speed on the Nvidia Flex and Nvidia Flow physics simulators, and how they can be used in VR. The talk will cover:

* Nvidia Flex overview and uses for soft and rigid bodies, cloth, ropes, liquids and bacon
* Nvidia Flow overview and uses for smoke and fire
* Hardware and performance considerations
* VR-specific rendering, interaction design, and performance considerations.
* UE4 integration and Funhouse mods
