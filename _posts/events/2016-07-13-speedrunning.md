#### The mechanics behind maximizing Guitar Hero scores
##### Daniel Lew

At a professional level, every video game engine requires knowing the rules inside out in order to abuse them for profit. Even a deceptively simple game like Guitar Hero can be manipulated in order to get ahead.

Dan will describe some interesting math and algorithms that can be applied to maximize scores, as well the subtleties of the game engine that people used for points. (Yes, people wrote complex programs in order to solve Guitar Hero!)
