#### Light Grey Art Lab
##### Lindsay Nohl, Chris Hajny and Jenny Bookler

[Light Grey Art Lab](http://lightgreyartlab.com/) is a collaborative gallery in Minneapolis. Their newest exhibition series has introduced a more interactive, game-centric approach to the gallery format. The first set of projects, Great Personality, is a series of dating sims based on the Meyers-Briggs Personality types. Their upcoming project is Dream Arcade, for which 30 artists are crafting assets for their own ideal platformer level. These levels will be implemented into a larger game and released with an overarching narrative alongside the exhibition opening in September.

Light Grey Art Lab will be sharing the backstory of the new exhibitions, the process of working with artists from all industries to create projects like these, and how this new approach challenges the current “gallery format.”


#### MathTap
##### Brett Nelson

Brett Nelson will share his results from the Day of Unity event, and his current project called MathTap.
