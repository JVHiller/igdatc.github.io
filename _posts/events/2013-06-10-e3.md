(This social event is 6/10, regular IGDATC meeting is 6/13)

IGDA Twin Cities is once again hosting an all day E3 social event at the Chatterbox Pub.  Stop by for lunch, dinner, drinks.  Or, hang out and "work".  Zach and Ryan will be there all day, futzing with depth cameras and Unity.

Bring fun card games or 3DS (please) or whatever, and an extension cord if you're serious about the laptop/work.   We'll be in the banquet room from 11am - 10pm, and maybe later.  Guests and strangers encouraged!.

Happy hour is 2-5pm.
