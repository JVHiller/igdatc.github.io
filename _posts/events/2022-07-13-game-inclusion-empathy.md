#### Games, Inclusion, and Empathy

Ethics and civics have always mattered, but perhaps they matter now more than ever before. Recently, with the rise of online teaching and movements like #PlayApartTogether, games have become increasingly acknowledged as platforms for civic deliberation and value sharing. We the Gamers explores these possibilities by examining how we connect, communicate, analyze, and discover when we play games. Combining research-based perspectives with current examples, this volume shows how games can be used in ethics, civics, and social studies education to inspire learning, critical thinking, and civic change. It illustrates various educational frameworks through a range of games including board and card games, online games, virtual reality games, and digital games like Minecraft, Executive Command, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Fortnite, When Rivers Were Trails, Politicraft, Quandary, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Featuring helpful tips and case studies, We the Gamers shows teachers the strengths and limitations of games in helping students connect with civics and ethics and imagines how we might repair and remake our world through gaming, together.

#### Creating a 3D Character: Programs Used and Process From Start to Finish

##### Joseph Ceranski

_[Watch on Youtube](https://youtu.be/hgei6iaJlbo?t=534)_

This presentation will be about the process of completing a 3d character for use in a video game. This is defined as a rigged and textured model of a character that is within a game engine (Unity). I will be going over my process of how I completed this character, starting from ideation sketches and moving through the steps of development. This includes the software that I used while going through each step, and I will be going over the software in the presentation in order of when I used them in creation. These software include MakeHuman, Maya, Marvelous Designer, Substance Painter, and Unity. Showing this process within these programs can hopefully be beneficial to some of those watching who may want to make a character of their own.

Hi, my name is Joseph Ceranski. I recently graduated from University of Wisconsin-Stout with a Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and Development-Art and a minor in Business Administration. Currently I am still based in Wisconsin, however I am looking to move across the country for employment, most likely California or New York. I was interested in video games since a very young age, and spent most of my life learning about them before I decided to make them as my career. While I enjoy making art as well as the art of games, my real goal lies in the business sector of game design. I am just hoping that I am able to utilize my skills in the industry and help make technological advances for video games.
