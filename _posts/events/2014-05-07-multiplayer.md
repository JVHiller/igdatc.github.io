IGDA Twin Cities is excited to co-host another Multiplayer Extravaganza and [Glitch](http://glitch.mn/) mixer.  

The Multiplayer Extravaganza is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local game makers bring to the events. Come share your passion for games, or sign up to show your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world.

Games we'll be playing:

We've coordinated with a number of local game developers and will have an awesome selection of games playing tonight! 

We've got 9 games from 7 local developers that will be available to play. And the best part, the developers will be there to criticize your play style (or vise-versa)!
