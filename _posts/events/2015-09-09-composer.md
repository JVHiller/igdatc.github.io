#### Indie Dev Survival: Fusing Business Strategy with Creative Design
##### Patrick Swinnea

Everyone knows the Indie Bubble has collapsed and there is no hope of surviving as an Indie Dev. What this talk presupposes is: Maybe there is?

Patrick Swinnea ([Omega Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omega-drive/id434937881?mt=8), [Merlin's Marble](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/merlins-marble/id513761904?mt=8)) looks back on six years as a one-man game studio... What worked, what didn't and how The Force Awakens could possibly be worse than the Prequels (j/k, it can't).

Topics include monetization, discoverability, development tools, humorous (angry) fan mail and thoughts on the future of solo game development as a business endeavor.


#### Composer Quest, Developer Challenge
##### Charlie McCarron & Thomas Spargo

Charlie McCarron produces the podcast [Composer Quest](http://composerquest.com/). As part of the show, he regularly gives composing "quests" to create new music based on a specific challenge, like score a short film, write a song based on a fortune cookie, etc. The next quest hopes to connect composers and game developers and create short games based on a theme (TBD). The end goal will be a gallery of new games with original scores to show off at [Gamer's Rhapsody](http://gamersrhapsody.com/) on November 13-14th.

Charlie McCarron along with Thomas Spargo from Gamer's Rhapsody will present their quest challenge in more detail and discuss the idea with the audience.
