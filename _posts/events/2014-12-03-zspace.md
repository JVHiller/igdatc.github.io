#### Using zSpace for visualization at Boston Scientific

Discussions and demos of how Boston Scientific is using zSpace systems for visualization and design. The zSpace workstations let you view 3D object from multiple angles, and interact with them in 3D space above the screen. The hardware is a combination of a unique 3D monitor, polarized glasses, head tracking and a 3D tracked stylus.

We'll also have a brief discussion on the upcoming Global Game Jam (Jan 23-25), and Oculus, PC Hardware, and other news.
