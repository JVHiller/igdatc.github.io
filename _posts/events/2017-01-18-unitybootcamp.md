The Global Game Jam is just around the corner, Jan 20-22! Join 100+ local creators of all skill levels and specialties. Sign up at Gamecraft.MN

This is our annual Unity VR/AR bootcamp before GGJ to get you up and running quickly on a new platform, plus Unity productivity tips to make the most of the weekend. This is a guided roundtable discussion - show up with tips and/or questions!

Last year, we had 6 VR/AR/Hardware based projects at GGJ. With consumer VR released, let's double it! Don't have VR/AR hardware? Do a Vuforia AR projct on phone, tablet, PC or Mac.
(Bring tripods and cleanable VR Covers if you're doing Vive. 2-day Amazon Prime shipped reccomendations here)

#### CES Highlights
##### Mark Jensen

But first, Marc Jensen will briefly share CES highlights including wireless Vives, tracked objects, inside-out tracked HMDs, and even more cool / less relevant stuff!

#### Unity VR/AR Bootcamp - Various

First, Zach Wendt will convince you that modern tools and libraries let you create a VR game with hand/object interaction and teleporting in under an hour. And, PC VR to a Unity project in a couple minutes.

Our setup/quickstart guide is back and updated to cover Vive, Rift, Gear VR, Daydream, Cardboard, HoloLens and Vuforia. We'l just cover the highlights of the guide, and leave the details online for you to use. Tools and versions are still changing fast, and vendor docs don't always keep up. Learn from our pain.

Likewise, we'll just hit highlights on a list of reccomended libraries, tools, art and animation resources. And, we'll gather additional suggestions from the group.

The majority of the time will be a guided roundtable discussion on workflow for VR/AR, Unity, and short projects like game jams. We want to hear everyone's tips and/or questions. But, to ensure great coverage for questions, We've also pre-gathered some voulenteers that have completed projects on all the major platforms and have participated in previous Global Game Jams.

    Thong Nguyen - Gear VR
    Matt Summers - Rift and Vive
    Tommy Sunders - VR interaction and art
    Patrick Swinnea - Daydream and Cardboard
    Zach Wendt - HoloLens, Vuforia, etc.

Also keep in mind, 80% of the work in a project is not VR-specific. General Unity tips and questions are very welcome, and much of what we'll discuss. We'll have Unity, a PC and Vive if needed - but don't want to burn time on demos or extensive live coding.
