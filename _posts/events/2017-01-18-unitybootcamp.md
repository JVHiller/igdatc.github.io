#### Unity VR/AR Bootcamp - Various

First, Zach Wendt will convince you that modern tools and libraries let you create a VR game with hand/object interaction and teleporting in under an hour. And, PC VR to a Unity project in a couple minutes.

Our setup/quickstart guide is back and updated to cover Vive, Rift, Gear VR, Daydream, Cardboard, HoloLens and Vuforia. We'l just cover the highlights of the guide, and leave the details online for you to use. Tools and versions are still changing fast, and vendor docs don't always keep up. Learn from our pain.

Likewise, we'll just hit highlights on a list of reccomended libraries, tools, art and animation resources. And, we'll gather additional suggestions from the group.

The majority of the time will be a guided roundtable discussion on workflow for VR/AR, Unity, and short projects like game jams. We want to hear everyone's tips and/or questions. But, to ensure great coverage for questions, We've also pre-gathered some voulenteers that have completed projects on all the major platforms and have participated in previous Global Game Jams.

- Thong Nguyen - Gear VR
- Matt Summers - Rift and Vive
- Tommy Sunders - VR interaction and art
- Patrick Swinnea - Daydream and Cardboard
- Zach Wendt - HoloLens, Vuforia, etc.

Also keep in mind, 80% of the work in a project is not VR-specific. General Unity tips and questions are very welcome, and much of what we'll discuss. We'll have Unity, a PC and Vive if needed - but don't want to burn time on demos or extensive live coding.
