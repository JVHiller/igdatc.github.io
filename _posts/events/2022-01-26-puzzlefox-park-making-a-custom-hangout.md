#### PuzzleFox Park - Making a Custom VR Hangout Space for Quest

_[Watch on Youtube](https://youtu.be/nQ4XAdjlL5s?t=1707)_

The PuzzleFox team invites you to join us at PuzzleFox Park, our new virtual hangout space.

Patrick Swinnea, Dev Jana and Brandon McKinney will give a short talk on how it all works, including how to build an app with Normcore networking, optimizing interactions between users, and then let you clowns run amok.

We can't say much more without spoiling the fun, but we promise you'll have a good time. :)
