#### Halfway Mark Report: The Convergence of History and Art in Developing Tombeaux
##### Dave Beck

Dave Beck will share a "mid-mortem" experience about developing Tombeaux, a first-person narrative, historical walking simulator that is set on the St. Croix River. Beck will speak about how the game's creation has incorporated artistic, historical, and local elements that might not always be found in the game development process.

Dave Beck is an artist, indie dev, and history buff, and also serves as both the Director of the [Game Design BFA Program](http://www.uwstout.edu/programs/bfagdd/) and the Chair of the Department of Design at University of Wisconsin - Stout. He also feels pretty lucky to be considered an "auxiliary member" of IGDA-TC, even if he does live in Scott Walker country. More information about his project can be found on his website, [Tombeaux An Interactive Experience](https://tombeauxgame.wordpress.com/).


#### Meet the UW - Stout IGDA

In the last five years the [UW - Stout IGDA](http://www.stoutigda.com/) has hosted multiple game jams and speakers. With a new executive board this year, they are taking this opportunity to tell us about their past activity, current situation, and future plans. This presentation will include an interactive portion to sollicite ideas and suggestions from the audience.
