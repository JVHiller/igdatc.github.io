Ken Patterson, Matt Heinzen and Ajani Boganey from Big John Games will be showing three new games, each for a different Nintendo Platform.

* *Coaster Creator 3D* is a 3DS game that allows easy creation of roller coaster track's using a draw the track method using the stylus. Players can create tracks, customize there coaster tracks and coaster cars. Players can also import Mii's and take them for rides.
* *Kart Krashers* is a DSiWare game that plays like a vehicle platformer. Player's drive karts through stages and collect stars and smash into almost everything that can find.
* *Big Bass Arcade No Limit* is an expanded version of our WiiWare Bass fishing game that hit #1. It is a lot of fun to play, and pushes the Wii's graphics to the limit. This game was built as a retail disc release.  A new challenge was added and programmed by a special guest star (Zach).
