#### MN VR and HCI Member Project Night 2016

A lot of new projects and/or new members have been appearing at meetings recently. So, we thought it would be fun to get a quick show and tell on as wide a variety of projects as possible (Not only VR, not only games, etc.)

Presentations will be fast (5-10 min timed), and informal - with some type of visuals being mandatory. Recently completed projects, incomplete/WIP, interesting graphics, shaders or HCI experiments are all encouraged.

Here's who's confirmed so far. Grab a Presenter ticket, and we'll add you to this list:

* Tony Bruno - Enterprise Constitution Class for Vive
* Paul Christian - Simple Stereo Drone Video / Thom Yorke's Face
* Paul Eckhardt - Beach Ball Vally / Zen Blade / Space Couch!
* Ryan Foss - It Puts the Ball in the Basket for Vive
* Martin Grider - Puzzle Prison: a VR puzzle game for PC and mobile
* Paul Lyrek - Sparky's Day - Educational Museum Experience
* Mike Medicinehorse - Trip to the Moon / VR for a convention
* Zach Wendt - Trampoline VR / 4 Vive controller experiments
