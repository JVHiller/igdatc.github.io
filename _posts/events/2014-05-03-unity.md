Some event details and updates since our April IGDATC meeting: 

Breakfast and registration starts at 9.  The first session is 9:30.  Lunch is also provided.

The Introduction to Unity session will be taught by J Marshall Pittman - who has an extensive background teaching Unity, art and animation pipelines.  http://jmarshallpittman.com/
(Unity is no longer sending someone, as was previously announced.)

The Unity Porting Lab is a working session aimed at intermediate/advanced Unity devs with an existing game.  You'll get hands-on help porting to Windows and Windows Phone, be able to test on a variety of devices, learn how BizSpark is being used for game development software and online hosting, and get signed up for free.

##### Requirements:

Note that for the Porting Lab you need a PC running Windows 8 or 8.1 (and Windows Pro if you want to try local device emulation.)  Mac users can get a Windows QuickStart kit on-site (which will run Windows 8 pro on your Mac OSX via Parallels Desktop 9).  Unity 4.3.3+ free or Pro will both work.  90-day evals of Windows are also an option.  More details are at http://unity3d.com/pages/windows/porting

For the Introduction to Unity session, you can work on any laptop running Unity 4.3.3+ free or Pro.
