#### My Pants RPG: A Debrief
##### Zachary Johnson

The first three episodes of my serial RPG [The Legend of Equip > Pants](http://gogetyourpants.com/) have been out for a few months.  It's a punny old-school pantsventure RPG broken up into 15-20 minute episodes.  Find out more at [http://GoGetYourPants.com/](http://gogetyourpants.com/) and play for free on iOS or at the Chrome Web Store.  This talk will answer all of your questions!

* Is there room in the market for 2D pixel art RPGs filled with bad puns?
* How do you make a cross-platform game like this?
* What are some marketing tactics for one-person teams?
* Just how many people will pirate the In-App Purchase for an entirely optional donation in a free game?
* How can I design levels so that heat-maps of player deaths form entertaining shapes?
* Discover all this, and more.
