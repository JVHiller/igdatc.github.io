#### Steam Store Page Optimization
##### August Brown

While making a great game is all very well and good, that work doesn't mean as much if folks on your launch platforms can't find your game. In this talk, we'll go over the very basic fundamental steps you can take to optimize your game's presence on Steam and make sure that your game is set up to fully take advantage of your marketing efforts.

August is a senior producer at indie-publisher Armor Games Studios. Over the course of the last decade he has helped ship over 20 titles and has yet to be fired for gross negligence.
