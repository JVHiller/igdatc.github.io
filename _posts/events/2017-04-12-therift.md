#### The Rift Between ZeniMax and Oculus, and What It Means for the Future
##### Brent Lorentz

February’s jury decision ordering Oculus to pay half a billion dollars to game company ZeniMax finds developers, game executives and hardware designers wondering what could come next. Among charges of violating a non-disclosure agreement, misappropriating trade secrets, copyright infringement and other allegations, the lawsuit poses real implications for players in an industry that is as collaborative as it is secretive.

Join Brent Lorentz as he walks us through the details of the case, how the charges came about, and highlights how the case has the potential to significantly alter the VR gaming landscape.
