41 Twin Cities folks (and some online friends from as far away as Iowa!) made 15 games in 48 hours this year for the Global Game Jam. Join us at this month's meeting to take a look at the games that were made, and hear about our experiences doing this jam online for the first time.

Play the games now on the official [Global Game Jam IGDATC Site](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/igdatc-msp-gamedev/games).
