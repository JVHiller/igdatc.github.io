#### Ham in the Fridge's Mobile Game Bumpin' Uglies
##### Bret Hummel

Bret Hummel will be showcasing Ham in the Fridge's first independent mobile game project, called Bumpin' Uglies.  Bumpin' Uglies is a sling-shot platformer puzzler in which you can design your very own Ugly — a hapless, adorably ugly little creature with the intellect of a block of wood — and fling him through world after world of endlessly fun combinations of physics-based puzzle obstacles to bump with other Uglies and dominate the gene pool, one bump at a time.


#### Pixel Kombat
##### Chris Figueroa and Ryan Schaefer

Chris and Ryan demo Pixel Kombat, a competitive tower defense game where players have full control over unique teams of units.
