#### Riddle Mia This
##### Colin McFadden and Samantha Porter

Riddle Mia This is a smartphone application that uses augmented reality to turn the Minneapolis Institute of Art into an escape room. Users enter a universe in which strange things are happening in the museum, requiring them to follow clues throughout the museum. Launched in Fall 2018, Riddle Mia This has been a huge hit with museum attendees, earning glowing reviews, press coverage, and enthusiastic interest in future releases. In this presentation, we'll explore the story behind the application, the development process, the launch, and the future directions for the technology.
