This month we are inviting participants of the Global Game Jam to share with us their experiences. If you participated in the Global Game Jam we want to hear from you! We want to hear about what you learned about designing, building and playing games by building one in 48 hours. What worked? What didn't? What was surprising? What did you struggle with? What will you do differently next year?
