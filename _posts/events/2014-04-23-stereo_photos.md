#### Stereo 3D Photography and Imaging 
##### Patrick Swinnea

Creating an immersive VR experience starts with understanding the basics of stereoscopic imaging. When is it awesome? When is it mediocre? When does it make your eyes bleed!!? And most importantly, how can we apply the tried and true rules of stereoscopic still photography to the creation of delightfully immersive VR?

The discussion will cover:

* stereo photography methods
* shooting techniques
* camera hardware and firmware hacks
* hardware and software tools
* guidelines for realistic vs artistic stereoscopic imagery
