IGDA Twin Cities is hosting the 4th annual All Day E3 Social at [Joe Senser's Sports Theater](http://www.sensers.com/bloomington.html) in Bloomington. We'll have streaming and satellite video all day long, along with game demos, multiplayer games, card and board games. Stop by any time. Have lunch, dinner, and/or drinks. Or, hang out all day and "work", run some playtests, etc.

Bring your projects, your game, card and board games, 3DS or whatever. Bring an extension cord if you're serious about the laptop/work. We'll be in the side room from 11am - 10pm, and maybe later. Guests and strangers encouraged!
