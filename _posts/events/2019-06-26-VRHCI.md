#### The first rule of Quest Qlub is: Tell everyone about Quest Qlub!

The Oculus Quest released last month, and the great capabilities at a new low price point have already led to a lot of excitement, experimentation and hacking.  We want to share all of the development/experimental knowledge to date, in a casual and open discussion.  Planned topics:

* Matt Summers - Unity LWRP, Google Seurat and Daydream Renderer, OpenVR streaming
* Patrick Swinnea (and Ty if he shows up) - Hardware modding, Tilt Brush to Unity pipeline
* Zach Wendt - Disabled Guardian issues and workarounds, adb tips, scrcpy for flexible mirroring
* You - We'd love to have others share their experiences with development on Mac, 360 video tips, feet/object tracking, networking, aligning playspaces, side loading/modding, sweat management, battery packs, personal projects/experiments, or anything!

Marc will give a quick overview of the newly announced Apple ARKit 3 - new features, capabilities, and likely use cases.
