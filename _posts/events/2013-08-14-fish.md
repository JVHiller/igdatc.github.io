#### Shooting Fish in a Barrel - Mobile App Postmortems"
##### Chip Pedersen - [Golden Gear Consulting](http://www.goldengearconsulting.com/) and [FrostBit Studio](http://www.frostbitstudio.com/)

18 year Game industry veteran Chip Pedersen speaks openly about transitioning his console studio to a mobile studio and the 3 apps they created for Bass Pro Shops.

He thought would it would be a great move for the studio. Hunting and fishing games were a popular genre in the App Store already. Combine that with a billion dollar license with huge marketing potential = Hit App. It should have been easy money, right?  It wasn't

This is a cautionary tale designed to help other developers think about their app design, development and marketing effort. Chip will save plenty of time for questions or if you want a private 1:1, buy him a beer.
