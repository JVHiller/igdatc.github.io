#### Different faces of combat design
##### Stephen McGregor, Monica Fan, Damien Crawford, Glen Henry

Discuss what combat design looks like beyond AAA space and why we love doing it
Stephen McGregor is a programmer for Future Club, specializing in Unity but has experience in other game engines as well. He also is a co-host on the podcast Nice Games Club, which has been going for over 5 years with over 250 episodes.

Monica Fan is a game designer at Pipeworks Studios with a passion for accessibility and cats. She has experience designing gameplay and system on PC, mobile and VR platforms. She enjoys tackling a good design challenge while drinking bubble teas.

Damien Crawford is the Head of Operations and only person at Cannibal Interactive, an independent game studio known best for games that use systems to generate challenge rather than being difficult in conventional ways, such as 'I Have Low Stats But My Class Is "Leader", So I Recruited Everyone I Know To Fight The Dark Lord'.

Glen Henry is the Founder and Project Director of Spritewrench Studios. A micro-studio based in Kingston, Jamaica, that focuses on smaller titles with an emphasis on narrative components and diverse character design. He uses his experience to nurture and encourage the growth of the region's Game Development sector and is eager to see more projects come out of the islands.
