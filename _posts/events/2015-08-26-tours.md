#### Virtual Tours
##### Bryn Erickson from Toursler and Paul Christian

Toursler Inc is the first large scale maker of detailed virtual tours for real estate, business and construction. We are currently in the process of opening a new office in the MSP area. Our virtual tours can be viewed on mobile, desktop, and soon in virtual reality. ...this is the first public sneak peak of our new VR viewer. Virtual tours are also more than just navigating around houses - they can be enhanced with before/after construction or remodeling, day/night views, apartment/hotel amenities, room layout options, etc.

Toursler has experimented with many technologies for capture, back-end processing and viewing. We're happy to share where we've been, what we've learned along the way, and answer (most) questions. We're planning to cover:

- Overview of the capture process in the field
- Spherical focus and stitching
- Our Computer vision approach vs using depth cameras
- Back-end processing
- Creating floor plans without blueprints
- Previous technology experiments
- Mobile and browser viewers
- VR use in Real Estate, and where it's going
