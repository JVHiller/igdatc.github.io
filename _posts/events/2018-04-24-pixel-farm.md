##### Ty Burks

Room-scale VR can be a super effective way to gather a crowd and engage event attendees, but it’s much different than just releasing a VR game. Pixel Farm has created several highly interactive experiences for events in the last couple years, such as Mascot VR at Twins Fest 2018, Character Playbook VR at the Super Bowl Experience, and 3M’s Safe Driving Challenge at ATSSA Conference. Focusing mostly on Mascot VR, we’ll be covering success and failure inside and outside the headset, going over our approach to design, usability, interaction and how to give a great demo to virtual reality first timers.

Ty Burks, Director of VR at Pixel Farm, has led teams in VR the last 3 years developing highly interactive games and experiences across several VR platforms. Former Creative Lead at Owlchemy Labs, he helped create Job Simulator and Rick & Morty: Virtual Rick-ality for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PSVR. Job Simulator was bundled with the original release of the HTC Vive and continues to be one of the highest selling VR games. Owlchemy Labs was acquired by Google in 2017. Previously Ty worked as a designer and artist in the game industry for 11 years, releasing licensed and original content for PC, Mac, and Mobile.
