#### The Journey of a Successful Video Game Media Convention
##### Thomas Spargo

Gamerâ€™s Rhapsody is a video game convention held in Bloomington, MN. The second annual convention was in November 2015 and celebrated video games and their creation through live performances of video game music; panels and workshops. Thomas Spargo, founder of Gamer's Rhapsody will talk about the convention, reviewing some of the aspects that were sucessful. Additionally, he will discuss the process of starting a business in Minnesota along with project management principles. Whether it's a game, an event, or a brand new business, a structured project management plan helps to keep any type of project on course and reaching milestones.

Thomas is a recent Augsburg College graduate in marketing and business analytics. In college, he started Gamer's Rhapsody video game convention taking place annually in the late fall along with a Knexus LLC, an event planning and consultation group. Thomas has been planning large scale events for over 6 years.
