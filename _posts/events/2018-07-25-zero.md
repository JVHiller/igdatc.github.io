##### [Team Zero](http://irteamzero.com/) - Ryan Schaefer, Tony Bruno, Shawn Flanagan, Gus Fink

Webster's dictionary defines "virtual reality" as "a realistic and immersive simulation of a three-dimensional environment, created using interactive software and hardware". Ingersoll Rand's Team Zero has been working with this wondrous new technology on a variety of endeavors and has graciously agreed to adorn you a crash course of how the modern industrial world can benefit from its many marvelous uses.
