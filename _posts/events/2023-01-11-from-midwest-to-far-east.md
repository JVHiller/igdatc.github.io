Video games are enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and of all ages. Growing up, many of us have dreamed of working at a AAA studio and making the next iconic video game. However, when you are from the midwest, far and far away from the major studios as does one enter the video game industry?

Mac Kendema will take you on his journey of entering the video game industry from working as a QA Tester for Activision, to a Community Manager for Square Enix in Japan and finally becoming the CEO of his own startup Borderless Translations. During this talk you will learn how to find video game resources in Minnesota and Japan, while also providing you with a roadmap to success on your journey through the video industry.

Former IT consultant for Turnberry Solutions, former Square Enix Community Manager, and Current Owner and Japanese to English Translation lead for Borderless Translations, McIsiah (Mac) Kendema. Has deep working knowledge of working with companies both in Japan and America. In his free time he takes part in video game jams, mentoring youth, and dancing to Blues music and afrobeats.
