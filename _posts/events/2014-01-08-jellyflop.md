##### Ashley McLaughlin and James Krantz from [Concrete Software](http://www.concretesoftware.com/web/)

A look at what went well with Jelly's journey and what didn't.  Spanning the entire project from prototype, through content creation, to release on iOS and Android, and getting featured in app stores. Ashley will be sharing the art/creative process while James will give insight into development structure and level design.

##### Erik van Mechelen

We want players to experience the familiar in a new way with Advantage Poker. One of our favorite childhood card games gone digital, it is at its core an on-the-go one-on-one 3-card poker variant.
