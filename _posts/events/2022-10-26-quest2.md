#### FOSS XR Conference 2022
##### Martin Grider

The Free and Open Source XR conference was a 2-day conference held at St Thomas this year. The talks were aimed at developers and tinkerers, and are available online: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqBPCPae10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqBPCPae10)


#### New XR Hardware
##### Zach Wendt

A quick overview of headset launches and announcements in the past month. I'll include the upcoming announcements on Pico 4 Pro, Lenovo VRX (and any other highlights) from Lenovo Tech World '22 and AWE EU 2022.

I'll also quickly summarize the announced capabilities and specs of Quest Pro, so Paul can focus on the parts he directly worked with.

#### Quest Pro development
##### Paul Christian

My experiences using Quest Pro for development and testing of Wooorld, which is launching alongside Quest Pro on 10/25. [https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4360608937312293/](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4360608937312293/)


#### Meta Connect 2022
##### Matt Summers and Zach Wendt

We're putting this last, since there's more than enough topics and news to go over. We're sure you've heard some interesting and/or incorrect takes from all the media coverage, and many of us have attended some presentations. We're going to try and get through all/most of the ~30 developer sessions before the meeting, and point you towards our favorites.

All presentations and developer sessions are available online: [https://metaconnect.com/](https://metaconnect.com/)
