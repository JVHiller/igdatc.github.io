##### IGDATC October **AT SURLY BREWING** 
##### Celebrating Joggernauts Launch

Our regular 2nd Wednesday IGDATC October meeting WILL BE AT SURLY BREWING IN MINNEAPOLIS in order to celebrate the Steam and Nintendo Switch launch of locally created game Joggernauts by Space Mace!

The event and venue are All Ages. We will be under the large tent in Surly's beautiful yard with a 15 foot television! Some pizza to snack on and limited free beer will be provided by Space Mace. Surly has a large variety of additional food and drink options.

Normal member and main presentation talks will resume at The Nerdery in November. This month come to socialize, play some games, and celebrate this major milestone our community has accomplished together!

Please help us spread the word to your friends from IGDATC that in October we will not be at The Nerdery and that we will be at Surly Brewing in Minneapolis instead!
