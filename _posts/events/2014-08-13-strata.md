#### Publishing Experiments for [Strata](http://www.graveck.com/strata/)
##### [Gravek](http://www.graveck.com/)

From concept to finish, marketing and deployment, the minimalist puzzle game Strata was an experiment in self-publishing for Graveck. Gain insight into the development process and the shotgun deployment strategy onto tons of different platforms, storefronts and sales models. Despite its simplicity as a game, a lot was learned and the developers are excited to share their findings in this post-mortem style presentation.

No topic will be left untouched as there will be juicy tidbits of knowledge from all aspects of the game's development and deployment.
