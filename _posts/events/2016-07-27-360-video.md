#### 360 Video
##### Chuck Olsen and Martin Grider of [Visual](http://visualisgood.com/)

What's the next-best thing to being at a concert, sporting event, or beach? The answer is increasingly 360 video, also known as VR video. Minneapolis' own Visual has produced 360 video experiences for clients ranging from media companies (MPR, StarTribune, Washington Post, Twin Cities PBS) to sports teams (MN Timberwolves, MN Lynx) and more (Mall of America, Newborn Foundation, U of M). But content alone is not enough! We've built a 360 video platform that includes VR apps for iOS/Android with Cardboard compatibility, and a dashboard for customers to update and manage their 360 content.

We're happy to share an overview of 360 video production and app development, with an emphasis on our first public platform customer: [Rhapsody VR](http://www.rhapsody.com/vr)
