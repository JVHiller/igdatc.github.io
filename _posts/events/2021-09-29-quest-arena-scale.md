We're celebrating the launch of the first Quest Arena scale game, with a special in-person event.  Big thanks to [REM5](https://www.rem5vr.com/) for getting us a huge (200 x 85ft) covered outdoor space.  Masks are required during check-in, and any time you can't maintain a 6 foot distance.  Please read all the event details below, and only share a Quest headset with people you rode with, live with, etc.

Where:
The ROC at St. Louis Park Rec Center.  ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/gj2xKHAoDA4bv2ag7))

  **To avoid road construction and park in the close lot:**

  * Navigate to the Target store by highway 100.
  * Head 1 block east on W 36th St. to the parking lot by the ROC and water park.

What:

  * BYOQ: Bring your own Quest 1 or 2 with Space Pirate Trainer DX installed. (REM5 also has a few headsets for loan - grab that specific ticket.)
  * Incredible immersion from walking to every part of your 10x10m playspace,  instead of teleporting or pushing a joystick to glide.
  * If you chose to set up co-location (same physical space), you can hear and taunt your opponent.  You can even test physical contact by touching controllers (* crazy immersion, but fiddly to get exact positioning.)
  * Learning tips and tricks for setting up large playspaces, and aligning them for co-location or repeatability (like mapping in your home and furniture.)
  * Advice on where and when to use Quest outdoors in your own neighborhood.
  * 30-60 min of play time (depending on attendance), plenty of socializing, and some new names for your Quest friends list.

When:

Wed 9/29 6:30pm

  * 6:30 check-in, play space assignment, and setup
  * 7:00 (sunset) play start
  * 8:00 pack up and mingle

Pre-event Checklist:

  * Wear a mask.  Add Quest, plus your hoodie or cowl for cyber-ninja cosplay!
  * Check for updates to Quest OS, Space Pirate Trainer, and ALL apps (It's painful to notice and pause each app auto-update onsite.)
  * (SPT supports app sharing if you own two Quests, but do this ahead of time.)
  * Check controller batteries, charge headset and do full shutdown.
  * Bring a clean microfiber cloth for lenses and cameras.
  * If you don't have a Quest case, keep sun out of the lenses (the cloth is enough.

You may also want a **resealable** water bottle, or even a small towel if you're the competitive sort.
