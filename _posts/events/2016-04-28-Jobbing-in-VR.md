#### "Jobbing in VR" - Designing a Room-scale VR game for Vive
##### Ty Burks

[Job Simulator](http://www.jobsimulatorgame.com/) is a tongue-in-cheek virtual reality experience for the HTC Vive. In a world where robots have replaced all human jobs, step into the "Job Simulator" to learn what it was like to job. Ty Burks will be sharing development stories spanning the earliest hand-made prototype Vives, being featured in the 4/5 Vive launch bundle, and early post-release impressions. But, the main focus of the talk will be on lessons learned and best practices for designing a room-scale environment in VR.

The talk will cover:

* Thoughts on the current state of VR development
* Adventures with hardware launch, and the first VR gamers
* Things that make me barf, other than moldy donuts.
* Object and Interaction design. Making it fun.
* Bold statements. Probably.
* Playtest nightmares to keep you up at night.
* Exit Burritos and other stories.
* Other random thoughts. Or just ask some questions about designing games for VR!
