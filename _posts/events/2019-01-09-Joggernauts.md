#### Joggernauts Post-Mayhem
##### Lessons Learned from Four Years of Dev, Travel, Pitching, and Publishers

Things Rob, Tommy, and Zach had never done before their game Joggernauts:

Built a game development team. Found a lawyer and created the game studio Space Mace. Boothed our game at over twenty events including GDC, E3, and PAX West. Pitched to publishers and consoles for almost a year. Signed with a publisher. Went full-time. Hired contractors. Kept up morale for over four years. Shipped a Nintendo Switch game. Shipped a Steam game. Saw what indie game sales numbers look like in 2018.

You could say we learned a lot. We're going to do our best to tell you everything important that we wish we had known before we started... if we can remember it.


#### Becoming a Game Whisperer
##### Dev Jana

I get it, when I was a pup u got to tell me what to do all the time. I had to learn everything from you. I grew up a bit and tried to tell you some stuff, but I was still building my voice. Sometimes other people tell hear me and tell you my thought. But I'm YOUR game and I'm going out there so why not take a few moments and listen to me now and then?

Dev is the President of Code and Noises at DevNAri, a Minneapolis-based two-person indie game team) Director of Instruction of the Full Stack Engineering program at Prime Digital Academy (a local coding boot camp).
