#### Sensory Room

##### Bradley Elenbaas

Interactive arts & crafts with digital displays. Fill out a coloring book sheet, upload it, and see your contribution come to life on-screen in the Sensory Room. I'll be giving a post-mortem on Sensory Room's 1st outing to [VGMCon](https://vgmcon.org/)'s Chillhop Lounge and its 2nd outing to Minnebar on April 22nd (tickets still available). Sensory Room uses a mismatched set of PCs & monitors to create an adaptable, budget-friendly room scale experience. It uses the PureBasic programming language to target low-end PCs and the Unity game engine to target mid/high-range PCs. Plus, plenty of additional C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Batch, CMD, VBScript, PowerShell, Zsh, and Sh to glue everything together. Yikes.

#### HTC Vive XR Elite early impressions

##### Marc Jensen

The HTC Vive XR Elite standalone  headset shipped in late March, and some of the software features are still a work in process (like Quest Pro.)  I use both, and I'll share the differences and pros/cons of both and my early impressions of using the Vive XR hardware for PC VR and for standalone VR.
