#### All Day E3 Social

IGDA Twin Cities is hosting the 5th annual All Day E3 Social at [Glitch HQ](http://glitch.mn/) near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. We'll have videos from E3 streaming all day long, including live press conferences from Microsoft and Sony. Stop by any time. Bring your laptop and "work", or just come to hang out, play some games, run some playtests, etc. If a social hangout is more your thing, plan to have dinner and drinks after work at the [Viking Bar](http://www.vikingbar.com/) (located right below Glitch) and hang out there as well.

If you've come to our E3 event before, we're doing things a little different this year. We are not showing videos at a bar/restauraunt so there isn't food or drink service. However, we'll have some time between live events for a late lunch, so plan to pack some food, order in or go to a nearby restauraunt. Additionally, you can bring your own drinks (alcohol is ok so long as you're responsible and legal age). We'll have a cooler full of ice you can keep them cool in. Between 4 and 8 there are no live press conferences, so if your interested in watching the EA's or Bethesda's prerecorded press conferences, we'll have them playing. Otherwise, plan for dinner at the Viking Bar, socalizing and drinks.Move between the Viking bar and Glitch as you please.


*Schedule*

The schedule is a little complicated so check out this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WRKnVmP-OkJdBktUTO8CMiiRykvZyoAV_2DRwMs7tck/edit?usp=sharing) with a basic timeline.

*Agenda*

There really isn't one. We'll have the keynotes on througout the day, but you're not obligated to watch them.

* 11:00 am doors open at Glitch and coordinators coordinate and setup, come on by
* 9:30 pm last keynote ends and we need to leave Glitch, but if enough people are intersted, we'll move downstairs to the Viking Bar.
* 2:00 am bar closes
