#### Join IGDATC for a social and Global Game Jam Play Party.  With beer.

Stop by any time drinks, dinner, or nightime entertainment..  We're in the banquet room at the  Chatterbox Pub St. Paul.

We're tweaking the format a bit.  We'll have a "featured" laptop on the main projector.  And anyone is welcome to install/launch any GGJ game that is great, funny, etc. and let people see/try it.  We'll also have random groups spread around the room.  Bring fun stuff!

Current plans:

* A "high score" contest on Surgeon Simulator 2013 throughout the night.
* Some bigger games of Operation Party on your phones (mind the shouting)
* Martin is bringing a selection of his favorite 2013 GGJ boardgames (early or later)
* My favorite boardgame from 2012 GGJ Saprobiont - the one we played until 1am.
* Put notable GGJ games and clever comments in our shared doc before/during/after the party.

If you've never been to the Chatterbox Pub, they're known for free board games, cheap Atari, NES and Sega rentals on retro TVs and couches, and great microbrew beer, ginger ale and root beer.
