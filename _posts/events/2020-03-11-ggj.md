#### GGJ 2020 Postmortems

This month: IGDATC will be having people who participated in this year's [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) talk about their latest and greatest(?!?) game jam creations! From plucky games about repairing levels, to live action video storytelling, this year's games were all created in 48 hours for the jam. Come find out what Minnesota jammers made this year, and learn valuable game development lessons as you hear about what went well and what went poorly for everyone involved.
