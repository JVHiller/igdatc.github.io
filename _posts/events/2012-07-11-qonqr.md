#### Crowdfunding Your Game
##### Justin Peck

Despite a few high profile successes, three-quarters of all Video Game Projects on Kickstarter fail.  What makes a project more likely to succeed? What are the things you should consider before crowdfunding your game?

Local game company, [QONQR](http://qonqr.com/), is preparing their own Kickstarter Project. Justin Peck, co-founder of QONQR, will give you a behind-the-scenes look and share the practical tips and tricks they have picked up along the way.
