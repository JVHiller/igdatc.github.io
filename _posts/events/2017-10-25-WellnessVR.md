#### WellnessVR
##### Chuck Olsen

[WellnessVR](http://www.visualisgood.com/wellnessvr/) is a platform for delivering relaxing & enriching 360º experiences to healthcare and wellness providers, using Samsung Gear VR. Visual conducted a study measuring the impact of WellnessVR on seniors with Ebenezer Senior Care, and we're happy to share the results.


#### HockeyVR
##### [Martin Grider](http://abstractpuzzle.com/) and [David Roberts](http://www.davidrobertsdesign.com/)

[HockeyVR](http://www.visualisgood.com/vr-ar-games-apps/) is a Vive game where you play goalie...with a real hockey stick. Visual partnered with sports marketing veterans and HiWay Credit Union to license branded versions of HockeyVR to NHL and college hockey teams, and other major brands. Martin and David will do a deep dive into the making of HockeyVR, including:

- Integrating a physical hockey stick and virtual glove
- Challenges of demo-ing at Xcel Center
- The Unity Asset Store, your VR pipeline on a budget
- Potential use of trackers
- VRTK to do the “heavy lifting” in VR
- Scripting your VR demo with a state machine
