#### UW-Stout Senior Games
##### Small Hours, by team Behind You

Small Hours is a stealth horror game about a little girl who is searching for her runaway cat in an other-worldly town. The player will explore, looking for signs of their cat, while also hiding from the threat of a hungry child-eating monster. [smallhoursgame.wordpress.com](https://smallhoursgame.wordpress.com/)

##### Umbrella Mondays, by team Turnip Town

Umbrella Mondays begins on a rainy morning when a little girl named Fella awakes, finds a journal, and journeys to explore a beautiful ruin of mystical wonder. Players help Fella protect adorable fire spirits with her umbrella, solve puzzles and unlock clues along the way about the significance of the green rain and Fellaâ€™s missing memories.
