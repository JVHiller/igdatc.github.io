The VRDL simultaneously tracks 6 to 8 people in a 50ft square space. This required development of a lightweight and untethered HMD called Perception that is based on iPad Minis and 3D printed shells.

The VR demo will be about 5-10 minutes per person, and the majority of the meeting will be spent learning about the applications for this space, hardware and software used, asset pipeline, and general Q&A.

The courtyard is in the center of the main/square portion of Rapson Hall. Plan to arrive between 6 and 6:30, the doors lock at 7. The closest parking is the Church St garage.

The VRDL is an active and evolving laboratory and we are currently documenting its use for a variety of purposes from educational to promotional, photographs of visitors to the lab may be reproduced or published in a variety of forums and formats. If you do not wish for your photograph to be used, please let us know before your visit.
