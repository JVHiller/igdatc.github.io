##### Mike Medicine Horse, Shawn Frueh from [Hybrid Medical Animation](https://www.hybridmedicalanimation.com/)

We'll share some of our recent VR and AR projects, and a quick look back at how the work has changed over the years (all the way back to the dark days before timewarp.) The majority of the talk will focus on our current art pipeline for adapting offline rendered assets for use in various types of VR and AR projects. We'll touch on:

 - Mobile AR/VR projects vs VR on a PC
 - FBX optimization
 - Maya to Alembic pipeline
 - Uses for Unity FBX export
 - Advanced shaders with Shader Forge
 - High end AR look development
