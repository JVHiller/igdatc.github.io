#### Bringing Imagine Me to the world
##### Chris Figueroa

This is a full story of how a game called Imagine Me went from a piece of paper, to getting on Steam and shown to thousands of people around the world. Expect stories of failed timelines, success at PAX East, online community successes/failures, and how networking can give you a boost to that next step in making a commercial video game.

The talk will focus on lessons learned about the parts of game making beyond just creating the software, and also cover a timeline of fortunate events starting at Steam Dev Days and Ending at a career with Unity 3D.
