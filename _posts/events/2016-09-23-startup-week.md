#### Game Dev Co-working and Donuts

Join game developers in their natural habitat... the donut shop! Enjoy the company of fellow game developers for the afternoon, or take the opportunity to start that game you've always wanted to make. All skill levels welcome, but be prepared to answer questions about what you are (or want to be) working on!

Some donuts will be provided!

[The Donutron](https://twitter.com/donutron) will also be in attendance, a MN-made donut-themed arcade cabinet made especially for Glam Doll, and featuring games made here in the twin cities.
