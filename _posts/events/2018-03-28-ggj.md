##### Gamecraft 2018 development teams

Five VR games were made at Gamecraft 2018 (our local site) for the 48-hour Global Game Jam. And, we're doing postmortems on all 5! Come here what went right, what went wrong, and see each project in action. Each one has rarely seen features:

 - [CMYK](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/cmyk) puts the VR player on tall towers to act as a spotter for a second player using a gamepad and monitor.
 - [Crosswired](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/crosswired) focuses on audio, as you play a galactic switchboard operator.
 - [Entropee - Druids in Space](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/entropee-druids-space) makes the VR player a large tree, helping 4 players on traditional split-screen.
 - [Ghost of a Chance](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/ghost-chance) makes you a ghost, trying to scare a computer controlled character out of their house.
 - [Intergalactic Noodle Ninja](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/intergalactic-noodle-ninja) features a tracked non-realistic body, tracked training sword, and no injuries yet.
