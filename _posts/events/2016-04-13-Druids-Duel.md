#### A Druid’s Duel Post-mortem
##### Kris Szafranski

It’s no secret that game development involves a multitude of difficult decisions from game inception to final release. Every step you take alters your view and affects latter choices. Only upon review can we see the path for what it was and determine just how good (or bad) our decisions may have been.

Join Kris Szafranski for an honest review of the development and launch of [A Druid’s Duel](http://www.druidsduel.com/), a turn-based strategy game released on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/333970/) in February 2015.

In this talk we'll dissect the development and business decisions made and their outcomes around common game development concerns: Game Design, Architecture, Project Management, Marketing/PR, and Community Management.

Kris Szafranski is the owner of [Thoughtshelter Games](http://www.druidsduel.com/), where he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and then launched the game A Druid's Duel on Steam in early 2015.
