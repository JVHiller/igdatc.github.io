##### Shane Huston, Marc Jensen, Matt Summers, Patrick Swinnea, RJ White, Zach Wendt

The annual Oculus (now Facebook) Connect 7 developer conference was this week. You can [see all the talks here](https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebookrealitylabs/videos/) (but we'll tell you the best ones.) We'll cover highlights from OC7, Quest 2, Venues and Horizon betas, and any other recent news.Zach Wendt will moderate the panel, try not to chime in too much, and move through the audience with a virtual microphone so everyone can share news or ask questions.
