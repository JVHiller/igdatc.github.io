#### GGJ and Quest Pro Updates

_[Watch on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/0LVpiI3PPKw?feature=share)_

#### Global Game Jam VR post-mortems and VR News - Various

Global Game Jam 2023 had nearly 40k jammers in 108 countries that made ~8k games.  We'll have quick post-mortems from two VR games from our local [IGDATC site](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/igdatc-2023) that you can try yourself.

We'll also briefly touch the VR-related announcements from GDC, GTC.  Also if you're the new owner of a Vive XR or PSVR2, share your initial impressions with us!

##### Quest Pro Updates and Demos - Various

Meta has been gradually releasing Quest Pro features, demos and SDKs since launch, and they recently cut the price from $1,500 to $1,000.  This makes for a great time to revisit Quest Pro use cases, value, hear what it's like for development and as a daily-driver... and let you demo the unique features for yourself!  We'll have multiple headset so you can try a small colocation demo, eye and face tracking, color passthrough, and the unique controller features (and a couple of GGJ games.)
