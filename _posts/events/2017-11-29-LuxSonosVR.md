#### [Lux Sonos](http://www.pixelfarm.com/work/lux-sonos/) - Pixel Farm

Pixel Farm created Lux Sonos VR for the AIGA conference in Oct. It was a great opportunity to put new design, interaction and abstract themes front and center. The VR world(s) and visuals are based on a recursive fractal. The plants and animals are procedurally driven, and an interactive music soundtrack creates unique performances based on user interactions. Most notably, the audience is given a cinematic view of the VR world, and they also physically interact with it...

VR designed for trade shows is generally "single player", but Lux Sonos is an experience that is shared between the user in VR and the audience outside. By placing their hands through custom built light-monitoring rings in the real world, audience members were able to alter visuals and sounds within the virtual world. This exchange created the sense that the VR user was not alone; rather, they were part of a joint collaboration of light and sound.
