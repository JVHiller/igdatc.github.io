#### UW-Stout's Game Design and Development Program Capstone Game Projects

Senior Students from University of Wisconsin-Stout's Game Design and Development Program will present their year-long capstone game projects. Multiple games will be presented by representatives from teams of artists, designers, and programmers. While the games are not finished *yet*, this will be a perfect chance to get a sneak peek into the development processes behind these games, before they are debuted a month later at the Stout Game Launch from 6-8pm on Wednesday, April 27th in Menomonie (only 60 minutes from the Twin Cities!). For more information, please visit [UW-Stout's Game Design Program](http://www.uwstout.edu/gamedesign.cfm) web site.

Games that will be presented include

* EVEREND - a 2D/3D puzzle platformer in which you are an owl trapped underground in a cave, trying to get back to your family
* BUILDING 37 - a 3D noir-style narrative exploration and puzzle game with a graphic novel aesthetic. You are trying to solve the mystery of what happened in Building 37...
* SMALL FOLK - a multiplayer co-op game, in which 3 players control the "small folk", while one player controls a giant "exterminator", trying to vacuum up the little guys.
* WITHERED ASH - a first-person gaming experience aboard an abandoned space station.
