##### Andres Reinot

Marmoset Skyshop is a suite of shaders and tools for high quality, high performance natural lighting in Unity 3.5 and 4 (both free and pro.)  It was released in May, and just received a Technical Achievement award at Unite 2013.  The talk will cover:

* History of [Marmoset](http://www.marmoset.co/) and [Toolbag](http://www.marmoset.co/toolbag)
* HDR Image based lighting workflow and tips
* Working with Unity Beast, Light probes, and quirks
* Getting nice renders on low-end GPUs and mobile
* Overview of Unity Editor Extensions
* Unity Asset Store overview, experience and strategy


#### Project Top Hat
##### Jajeev Nithiananda and Simeon Gbolo

One artist. One programmer.  Six months to create a quality game app for Android, a platform known for its' library of  notoriously derivative junk.  Learn how two ordinary guys, Jajeev Nithiananda and Simeon Gbolo, we're able to make something completely from scratch in less than a year.  As one might expect, it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine.
