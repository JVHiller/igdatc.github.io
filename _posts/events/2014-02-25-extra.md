Come to Grumpy's downtown and play some games with us! We'll have various games created for the Global Game Jam last month, as well as Sports Friends and various other multiplayer games to fall back on. Feel free to bring your own! (Bring your 3DS for that sweet streetpass action, or get in on a game of Zelda: Four Swords.)

Show up on time, because happy hour only goes until 7.

More info and further discussion can be found on the IGDA-TC google group.
