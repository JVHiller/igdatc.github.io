#### Successful Game Soundtracks
##### Emily Reese

Many games today have professionally composed musical score and often includes a soundtrack. Some soundtracks are lucky enough to have life of their own, away from the game. What makes a soundtrack successful outside of the game? Additionally, there are many great examples of musical pairing with narrative from the classical world and what we can learn from those examples. Emily Reese is on-air host for Classical Minnesota Public Radio and avid gamer. She is the host and producer for [Top Score](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/top-score/), Classical MPR's podcast about video game music and it's composers.
