#### Teensy and Addressable LEDs
##### John Bauer

[Teensy](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) is a small, cheap and friendly microcontroller/board that works great for quick hardware projects.

I'll give a quick overview of the Teensy development envrionment and community.  Most of the time will be demonstrating using WS2801/11 addressable LEDs along with controlling regular motors, stepper motors and servos. Time permitting, I can also demonstrate connecting a bluetooth module and receiving data from an accelerometer/gyro.  I'm also working on an infinity mirror concept that I'll bring along. 

The addressable LED strips make wiring easy, they are up in a lot of projects.  Some example videos:
