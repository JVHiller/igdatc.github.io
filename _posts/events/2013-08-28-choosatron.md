#### Choosatron Interactive Fiction Machine
##### Jerry Belich

Software developer and storyteller Jerry Belich will be discussing his jump into the Maker movement with the [Choosatron](http://choosatron.com/) (currently a [live Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jerrybelich/the-choosatron-interactive-fiction-arcade-machine)!). From prototype to production, in less than a year his project has captured the attention and imaginations of both the literary and technical communities. Some of the topics will include...

* Challenges of a first hardware project - knowing how little you know
* Software/firmware of the Choosatron, unlimited story length in cramped space
* The Literary World: Getting left behind as the technical generation grows up
* How the Choosatron hobby project got promoted to product development
* The benefits of not trying to solve a problem
* China and Kickstarter: The terrors of manufacturing and selling promises
* Why we are in a revolution now that you'll kick yourself in a few years for not being a part of
* It's never been a better time to make your ideas into something real, but it's good to be prepared!
