We're returning to PuzzleFox Park, after the super fun meeting there in January.  We'll check out the new social features (photo booth!) and exercise the new presentation features with a triple-header of quick presentations!!!

#### Vive Flow Dev and App Store
##### RJ White, Soaring Roc Studio

I made a launch title for the HTC Vive Flow - a standalone headset targeting non-gamers.  I'll share my experience with the hardware, the current state of the app store, and photos of my kids wearing the biggest sunglasses ever!

#### Focus 3 / Oculus for Business Alternatives
##### Marc Jensen, space150

With Oculus for Business winding down, we evaluated HTC Vive Focus 3 as a replacement for an existing Quest 2 project.  We also looked at 3rd party device management options for Quest, including one crazy option!

#### GDC and vMed22 (Clinical uses of VR) highlights
##### Zach Wendt

From upcoming consumer hardware to cutting edge medical research and treatments using VR, we'll cover the best!  Fast!  (If you went to GDC please stand up and share your experience.)
