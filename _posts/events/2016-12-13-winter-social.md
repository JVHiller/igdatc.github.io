#### Winter Social at Republic Bar

Join us at Republic (Seven Corners) for beverages, good conversation, and fun! The party begins at 6:00pm on Tuesday, December 13th and goes late. Like all IGDA-TC and MN VR and HCI events, this is free and open to the public. All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).

*Winter Party Instead of Presentations*

We will not be having our regular meetings in December. Instead, come to Republic Seven Corners to hang out and relax at our casual winter social! We'll have some video games and board games to play, of course. Feel free to bring your own! We know it is a busy time of the year for everybody, so please feel welcome to stop by any time during the night. We'll be chilling and talking until they kick us out.

*Global Game Jam 2017*

The Global Game Jam 2017 starts Friday January 20th. We've partnered with Glitch again, so if you're interested you can register at GameCraft.MN. 31 games were made last year, 6 of which used VR and/or HCI. Let's make more this year!

See you at Republic!
