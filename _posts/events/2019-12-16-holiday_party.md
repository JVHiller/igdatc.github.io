#### Winter Social!
We will not be having our regular meetings in December. Instead, come to Joe Senser's Kitchen and Bar to hang out and relax at our casual winter social! We'll have some video games and board games to play, of course. Feel free to bring your own! (There are plenty of TV's to plug in to.) We know it is a busy time of the year for everybody, so please feel welcome to stop by any time during the night. We'll be chilling and talking until they kick us out.
