#### IGDATC and Ham in the Fridge present: BUMP-N’-JAM

[Ham in the Fridge](http://www.haminthefridge.com/) — the team behind Bumpin’ Uglies (and a long history of Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and KidsWB titles) — extends a unique invitation to participate in a lively, hands-on jam-style brainstorming session for Bumpin’ Uglies.

Ever wanted to get your hands dirty coming up with brand new gameplay ideas for a franchise with the attention of the big leagues? Riff with peers and industry pros, and build off of top-notch artwork, animation and sound design?

Here’s your chance to help shape the future of games in the Bumpin’ Uglies universe, and even get an opportunity to join the team to bring them to life.  Expect to participate in an active brainstorming session, and to make full use of the wall-to-wall whiteboards!

Food and drinks will be provided.  Please get familiar with the brand by downloading and playing [Bumpin' Uglies](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bumpin-uglies/id532884096) for iOS.
