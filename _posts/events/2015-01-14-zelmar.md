#### Designing a Shoot 'em Up
##### Sati Bros

Sami Sati and Erick Sati will be discussing the development of their game Astral Gunners. Astral Gunners is a fast paced Shoot 'em Up in development for PC.

Astral Gunners puts a strong emphasis on unique characters and scoring mechanics. They will talk about their first foray into game creation and how they are using Game Maker to its fullest potential. They will also discuss the how creating their own Shoot 'em Up helped them learn the reasoning behind common design decisions, and why the best games in the genre still feel like they haven't left the arcades.
