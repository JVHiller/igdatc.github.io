##### DevNAri: Ari Carrillo and Dev Jana

We're DevNAri - a two-person game development team based in Minneapolis. We're releasing our first game, Newt One, on PC/Mac on the same day we're doing our Postmortem at IGDATC! It is our belief that games can make lives better - and happier! We lovingly craft nonviolent, colorful games with a focus on music and we hope to see you there.

Newt One rewards you for how much life you bring to the game world, not how much life you take from it. Embodying your progress through color and music, Newt One's purpose is to generate happiness. We've shown it at 2D Con, Gamer's Rhapsody, TEDx Minneapolis, MinneDemo, IndieCade, MinneBar, and other places like IGDATC last year.

Let's talk about how awesome making a game can be while also how much of a pain in the butt it can be. Should be fun!


#### Global Game Jam Postmortems
##### Global Game Jam 2018 Participants

Come hear rapid-fire recaps from this year's Global Game Jam participants. There will be an open call for everyone to show off their games for 5-10 minutes and talk about their experiences. Did you participate? We want to hear about it! Bring your prototype for folks to play at the bar after!
