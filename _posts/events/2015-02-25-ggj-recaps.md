#### Global Game Jam 2015 VR and HCI project post-mortems and interaction design discussion

We had five(!) projects at the local 48-hour Global Game Jam with VR and/or unique HCI. Projects can be viewed and downloaded at [http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games)

We're going to do post-mortems on at least 4 of these projects: The focus will be on VR/HCI interaction design aspects of the project. We'll also be sharing lessons learned about workflow, debugging and tuning/playtest tips.
