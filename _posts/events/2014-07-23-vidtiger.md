**FutureKave** is an interactive 3D game experience that transports you to a realm of social play and possibility. Your body movement paints and sculpts the spinning moon beneath your avatar. What begins as a desolate moonscape is brought to colorful life as you move and interact with other players. FutureKave is a grand experiment at the intersection of art and technology, the real and the virtual.

**VidTiger** has shown FutureKave at several venues and events, and most recently as a part of Northern Spark. Chuck Olsen, Maxwell Hoaglund and co. will give a broad presentation on the FutureKave project. Expect to hear about:

- Concept and iterations
- Tech prototypes for character control
- Integrating Kinect into Unity
- How we track more than 2 people on Kinect 1
- Lessons learned about setup, logistics and the audience

...and of couse, live demos!
