#### Winter Social / Holiday Hootenanny

December is a busy time for everyone, so our regular monthly meeting in December is replaced with a casual social event. This year, come join us at Republic (Seven Corners) for good friends, games to play, and general fun! The festivities begin at 6:30pm on Wed, Dec 10 and go late. Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight! The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.

Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public. You are welcome and encouraged to bring friends, significant others, and strangers. Come for dinner, have a beer or lemonade, play some games or just hang out.

**Local Games Screen**

As part of the game playing and socializing fun, we want to encourage local game makers to show off their own current projects. Sign up for the "bring a game" ticket type, and we'll contact you with details. This is a very friendly and helpful opportunity to do playtesting or just get general encouragement.

We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers. Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a videogame, etc.
