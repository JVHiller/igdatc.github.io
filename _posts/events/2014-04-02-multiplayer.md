IGDA Twin Cities is excited to announce our first colaboration with [Glitch Gaming](http://glitch.mn/) from the U of M.  We also timed this social event to the end of the [IEEE VR](http://ieeevr.org/2014/) conference, and a special MN VR/HCI meeting the Fri before with guest speaker Impulsonic.  Welcome cybernauts!

All of our events are open to the public.


#### Mixer and Multiplayer Extravaganza!

We'll once again be chatting, eating, drinking and most importantly playing and shouting at the greatest in shared-screen multiplayer games, but this time on 4 screens and platforms at once. 

We're bringing back the crowd pleasers **Starwahl, Samurai Gunn and Gang Beasts**.

We'll be adding **Towerfall, SpeedRunners, Hidden in Plain Sight**, and testing a few more.
