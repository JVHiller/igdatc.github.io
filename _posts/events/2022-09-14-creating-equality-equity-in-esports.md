Creating Equality and Equity In Esports" is one of the biggest concerns facing esports titles in present day. Though the developers may not have necessarily created the systemic issues of inequality faced by marginalized groups in society today, they can and should play a role in creating the solutions. Before you get too excited, no, I don't have all the answers for you. There is no magic formula that I can give you all and that can be implement to create sweeping changes across the world of gaming overnight, but what I am here to give is a few places we can all start. I'm here to talk about strategies that we can implement, A/B tests that we can run, real world examples of where I have implemented and tested these strategies myself, and the outcomes of those real world tests. I believe gaming can be a driver for change in the real world, and esports may be one of the most perfect places to start.

Me and firestorm are going to discuss about who we are and how we met in person. We will also discuss about the discord we created together and the events that we have attended to together and our goals for what we want in the future as individuals. Once we do introductions and who we are and what our goals are then we will proceed to talking about LANFest . LANFest will be our main topic on how we both got started in the charity event and what its like to be a staff member and also what its like to run the whole Minnesota LANFest chapter as chapter admin! Once we go into details about that we will end our conversation there about where we see ourselves in 5 years from now with LANFest .
