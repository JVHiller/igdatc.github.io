They will also be announcing "Feeding Freddy", which is a serious/learning game currently being created by a unique colaboration with the University of Wisconsin, Stout.

Matt Heinzen, project lead for "Just Jam", will be demonstrating this unique software experience that combines music crafting with some fun visual effects. Anyone can create music with this software.  He'll cover the technical, design and unique control challenges in bringing this title to the Wii.

Ken Patterson will be presenting "Big Bass Arcade" for DSiWare. This is Ken's 8th fishing game and it benefits from all his lessons learned.

* What sells and why
* How the download audience differs from retail
* Changes with 3DS
