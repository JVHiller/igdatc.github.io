#### MN VR and HCI Holiday Social and Demos

This is primarily a social event. But, we always like to show work! Local devs and artists have confirmed 7 very unique demos so far, with some really fun bells and whistles. No matter how hardcore, I guarantee you haven't experienced even half of these. If you have, we really should hang out.

We'd love folks to bring more demos and show off work. Or, just some GearVRs to test the networked/social VR while in the same physical space! Remember the tag line of MN VR and HCI: Anything interactive with weird input or output ...just not THAT weird. Portable is best, but there is a ramp from street level - please confirm ahead for heavy/large/crazy demos.
