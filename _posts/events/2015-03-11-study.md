#### Does it matter who you play with? An investigation of socially supported learning in a multiplayer video game environment
##### Nic VanMeerten

Many people enjoy engaging with the complex systems within video games that are created for entertainment. Although, it is difficult to teach people how complex systems work. Several exploratory studies have shown that learning within these video games is driven by social interaction. Thus, based on theories of learning, it is reasonable to believe that individuals who play with those that are more skilled than themselves will develop at a faster pace and have a more enjoyable experience learning the game. To study this hypothesis, logged player behavior data from the popular video game League of Legends will be used to investigate whether playing with more skilled players will translate to larger gains in performance and a better understanding of the game itself. The findings from this study will provide insight into how people learn within video game environments, which may inform the development of more efficient training systems in multiplayer video games.

Nic is the [Directory of Interactive Technology for Glitch](http://glitch.mn/member/executor/) and is a gradutate student at the University of Minnesota. This is his first-year gradutate project.
