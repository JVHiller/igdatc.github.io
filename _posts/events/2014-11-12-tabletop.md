#### Tabletop Game Design Tools and Tips
##### Martin Grider

Martin Grider will talk about his experiences designing a fairly complex tabletop game over the course of several years. He'll talk generally and specifically about using spreadsheets to help with game design (both tabletop and video game). He'll also discuss and demonstrate Playtest, a tool for converting spreadsheet data to printable playing card prototypes.

Martin is the owner of [Abstract Puzzle](http://abstractpuzzle.com), and has made a number of mobile games avalable on iOS.


#### Automating Gameplay (aka Cheating)
##### Ryan Foss

Ryan Foss has developed a way to automate game play on a few of his favorite mobile games. He will explain and demonstrate his missuse of testing tools that allows his computer to play for him.

Ryan is the co-owner of [Duck Duck Boom](http://www.duckduckboomgames.com/) and promises that some day they will release a game.
