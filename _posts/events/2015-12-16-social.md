#### December 16, 2015 IGDA-TC Winter Social

Join us at Republic (Seven Corners) for beverages, good conversation, and fun! The party begins at 6:00pm on Wednesday, December 16th and goes late. Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public. All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).

Winter Party Instead of Presentations

We will not be having our regular main IGDA-TC meeting at the Nerdery in December. Instead, come to Republic Seven Corners to hang out and relax at our casual winter social! We'll have some video games and board games to play, of course. Feel free to bring your own! We know it is a busy time of the year for everybody, so please feel welcome to stop by any time during the night. We'll be chilling and talking until they kick us out.

See you at Republic!
