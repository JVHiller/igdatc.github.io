[QONQR, the GeoSocial Game of World Domination!](http://qonqr.com/) QONQR (pronounced “conquer”) is a massively multiplayer virtual world, a GeoSocial game layer, built on top of the real world using smartphone GPS technology and location-based services.

QONQR is a persistent and evolving computer universe in which players engage in location-based battle and intrigue. In the QONQR world, agents wage war for supremacy around the globe and around the clock.

From Startup Weekend to South by Southwest QONQR has been showing potential and gaining momentum. Local indie dev Andy Pickett talks about GeoSocial Games both from a game design and business perspective.
