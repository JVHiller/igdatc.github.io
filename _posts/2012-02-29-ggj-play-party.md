Join IGDATC for a social and second Global Game Jam Play Pary.  Now with beer and a short list of ~30 games reccomended by GGJ sites.  Stop by any time drinks, dinner, or nightime entertainment.  Happy hour is 2-5 and 10-12.  Oddly, setup is 4:30.

We're in the banquet room at the Chatterbox Pub St. Paul.  We'll have:

  * a variety of GGJ board/card games, including [Saprobiont](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/saprobiont) - the one we played until 1am.
  * A pair of projectors connected to laptops and gamepads for the vidgames
  * An iPad for the iGames
  * Power and WiFi - feel free to bring a laptop, we'd love to try some of the networked games.

If you've never been to the Chatterbox Pub, they're known for free board games, cheap Atari, NES and Sega rentals on retro TVs and couches, and great microbrew beer, homemade ginger ale and root beer.
