NOTE: because this meeting is being hosted at BAE Systems special circumstances are required for security. We ask that registration be completed by May 9th. A valid form of ID will be required for admittance. Visitors who are international (foreign citizenship, or dual citizenship) must contact us for admittance by May 2nd. Sorry no food provided.

The May meeting is being hosted at BAE Systems in North East Minneapolis. Ryan Foss will present a number of live demonstrations of the Modeling and Simulation work being done there. BAE Systems uses Modeling and Simulation to support large and small defense programs, from naval gun systems to ground combat vehicles and system analysis.

This event is a field trip to BAE Systems’ plant in NE Minneapolis, MN (near East River Road and I694). Detailed directions and instructions for attendance will be sent to registered attendees.

Tour will include:
- Virtual Integration Center, a theater/conference room with a large 8 by 23 foot immersive curved screen with pixel management system.
- Demonstrations of a naval land attack scenario and operational virtual prototype
- Two serious games: an infantry fighting vehicle under attack and a naval small boat attack and defense simulation
- Active Immersion Simulation Lab, combining motion capture, simulations, virtual and real environments into a “mixed reality” environment.
