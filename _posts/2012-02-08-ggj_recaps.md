The 2012 Global Game Jam ended up with 244 sites in 48 countries hosting almost 11,000 participants.  Nearly 2,300 games were created.  IGDATC did it's part with 27 participants and 11 game projects.

Come and hear a recap of the GGJ event and experience, and brief post-mortems from the IGDATC GGJ teams.  Then, play and rate some of the 2300 games to help find the gems.

Bring laptops, smartphones, ipads (and a PS3 or 360 controller if you've used it with a laptop before.)  We'll also have a selection of the board games ready to play in the cafeteria.
