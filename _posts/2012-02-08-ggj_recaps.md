The 2012 Global Game Jam ended up with 244 sites in 48 countries hosting almost 11,000 participants.  Nearly 2,300 games were created.  IGDATC did it's part with 27 participants and 11 game projects.

Come and hear a recap of the GGJ event and experience, and brief post-mortems from the IGDATC GGJ teams.  Then, play and rate some of the 2300 games to help find the gems.

Bring laptops, smartphones, ipads (and a PS3 or 360 controller if you've used it with a laptop before.)  We'll also have a selection of the board games ready to play in the cafeteria.

* 6:30 GGJ 2012 Recap and quick post-mortems from IGDATC teams
* 7:30 GGJ Play Party - Play and rate 2300 video and board games, note your favorites

        <p>Controls: X = Run, Z = Jump or Double Jump, Left and Right arrow keys to move. Also you can wall jump!</p>
        <p>I worked on a platformer that originally was suppose to be you running around the world. When you died you would become a random animal. Instead this just it a straight up platformer and it feels like a solid platformer and I’m proud of that.</p>

        <p>This game plays in an endless scrolling left and right world and has a hardcore player playing a 2D platformer, and a casual player networked viewing the other players status updates from their game. Then they can interact with them using a facebook-like interface.</p>

    <div class="ggj-game-description">
        <p>Players must navigate a series of puzzles revolving around collecting minions in order to serve your will and solve your puzzles. As players collect more minions, they start each level with them, and eventually loop around to the beginning, allowing them to experience the same easier levels with a vastly increased supply of minions. The game can be replayed infinitely, or at least until the player has too many minions to be handled by their system memory.</p>

        <p>Yggy shoots seeds into mudmen changing them into vegetation. It takes 3 hits to turn a mudman. Mudmen can also attack Yggy. A level is over when vegetation has reached 100%. (We weren’t able to get in the health drops, mudmen becoming vegetation, full vegetation ending, or screen transitions to new levels. But they were intended! &#x1F600; )</p>
