<p>Ryan and Tori invite Zach and Chris to the show to talk about the July meeting, specifically focusing on Kickstarter and game developers.  We compare our wallets after the Steam Summer Sale and discuss some of the games we've been playing.  OUYA, we have to mention OUYA, as well as other console news, specifically leaked specs related to the Wii U and next Xbox.  Sprinkle in some hijinks and other merrymaking and you get another episode of the IGDA Twin Cities Podcast.</p>
