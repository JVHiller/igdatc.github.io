<p>It turns out is hard to be interesting, so Ryan and Tori invite Zach Wendt and free agent Ryan Schaefer to join them and discuss E3.  That's right, E3 happend and the podcast crew is full of opinions, information and false memories!  They also talk about Zach's experience with, and recent IGDATC presentation regarding his Oculus Rift, the new and affordable VR headset (made popular on Kickstarter).  Host Ryan also shares his Ouya experience, and how his family is accepting another console.  So plug in your controller, wave your arms, put on your headset interface and prepare to download!</p>
