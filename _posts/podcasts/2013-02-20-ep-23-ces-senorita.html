<p>After the December break, and January's Global Game Jam, we're proud to release an extended blathering audio file of awesomeness.  Ryan, Tori, Jacque and Zach go off the rails in this, the 23rd episode of the IGDA Twin Cities Podcast.  Where has Jacque been?  What's good to watch on Netflix?  What's the name of that game you can't remember?  What would you pay for a game?  These, and many more tangents and random ramblings ahead.</p>

<p>Show Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Personal data and finding games</li>
<li>CES, interesting things</li>
<li>What would you pay for a Game?</li>
<li>Code Hero, woes me...</li>
<li>much more</li>
</ul>
