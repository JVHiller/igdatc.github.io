##### (Updated 09-14-2021)

<p>Considering that COVID-19 transmission rates in Minnesota remain <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view" target="_blank">substantial or high in all counties</a>, we have decided to continue the suspension of our <strong>in person</strong> meetings until further notice. We will continue holding virtual events at 6:30pm every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Wednesday on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/igdatc" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can engage with our community via Slack and Discord. If you are not currently a member of the <a href="https://mspgamedev.slack.com/" target="_blank">MSP Game Dev Slack</a>, you may request an invitation to join <a href="https://mspgamedevslack.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. For the Twin Cities Gamedev Discord, go <a href="http://discord.igdatc.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. To join the IGDA parent organization&rsquo;s Discord, please go <a href="https://discord.gg/igda" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please bear with us as we experiment with our options for an all virtual format. We will continue to monitor the situation, and give updates as frequently as possible. If you have any questions or concerns you want to bring to the board, please do not hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:igdatwincities@gmail.com" target="_blank">igdatwincities@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>The IGDA Twin Cities Board</p>
