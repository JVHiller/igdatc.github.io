#### RJ White

Back again to talk more about mobile VR and my most recent Oculus Go release, [FireZone](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/1869823143072019/), an online VR multiplayer shooter inspired by classic FPS games. I'll talk about the process I went through developing my first multiplayer game, marketing it, and using the positive reception from its release.

My talk will cover:

* Mobile VR - Quick refresher for those still unfamiliar, and updated for 2019
* Planning an online game - Where to find the "add multiplayer mode" button in Unity
* Marketing - Taking the lessons learned from my previous title seriously
* Release - Getting the game finished and on the store is only half the battle

I'm RJ White, and I'm a VR developer at Ghost Productions. I live in the Twin Cities with my wife and three children. I previously released Hardlight Blade on the Oculus Go (and later Rift) and most recently FireZone for the Go and Vive Focus. I'm currently working on projects related to FireZone and expanding the core gameplay for bigger experiences.

#### Mixed Reality Dev Days 
##### Zach Wendt

A quick overview of the 2-day Microsoft [Mixed Reality Dev Days](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mr-dev-days) event, and impressions of the non-final HoloLens 2 and Azure Kinect hardware. We'll also have some extra time to discuss all the other VR and AR hardware announced since last month.
