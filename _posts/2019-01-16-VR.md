#### IAAPA Attractions Expo, VR Roundup
##### Patrick Swinnea, [PuzzleFox Interactive](http://puzzlefox.co/)

Patrick Swinnea brings us a tech report from the latest IAAPA Attractions Expo in Orlando, IAAPA's weeklong trade show and education conference for theme parks, museums, family entertainment centers, science centers, resorts and zoos.

IAAPA Expo 2018 hosted over 1000 companies showcasing products for the amusement industry, with close to 10% of those selling VR, AR or Mixed Reality.

Learn about all the crazy tech on display (including crazy displays) â€“ such as "holographic" tables, motion tracked trampolining, VR paragliding and some black magic thing called DeepFrame.
