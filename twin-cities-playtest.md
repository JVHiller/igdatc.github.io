A new online-only event, every third Wednesday, 6-9pm CT, for live testing of in-development games. Sessions are streamed to Twitch, where anyone can watch, and sign up to play next!

Players don‚Äôt download builds and do not need a streaming setup. Devs only need to send an existing build to us. Games are hosted on a server running Parsec, a low-latency remote desktop service for games, which can even support ‚Äúlocal‚Äù multiplayer titles.

#### Developers!

Want your game tested? Contact Peter Yang (@ZettoVyker#5046 on the [Twin Cities Gamedev Discord](https://discord.gg/Q4uqaZe)). Once on the schedule, you'll send builds to Mark LaCroix (@Mark LaCroix#7985).

#### Players!

Instructions to participate:

_Before the event:_

* Create a Parsec account: [https://parsecgaming.com/signup](https://parsecgaming.com/signup)
* Install Parsec: [https://parsecgaming.com/downloads/](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads/)

_During the event:_

* Post in #events-chat (on Discord) letting us know your Parsec username (and your IRL name if it‚Äôs different from your Discord nickname).
* Open Parsec and click the Friends tab. Select Add Friend, type in igdatc, and send us a friend request.

_When it‚Äôs your turn:_

* Mute your browser or close the Twitch stream. We don‚Äôt want audio feedback!
* You'll be given access to the Event Stage voice channel, join that now! NOTE: If you‚Äôre not muted, your voice will be live on Twitch.
* Once you see an option in the ‚ÄúComputers‚Äù tab in Parsec to connect to OWLBOX, click that!
* After your request is approved, the game will take over your Parsec window and you're ready to play!

**Players:** Be willing to take notes/type out your comments for the developer. It's valuable intel! Be honest but be kind: unfinished games aren't yet finished!

**Developers:** Be present for questions and be open to constructive (and otherwise) criticism and feedback. Remember, the player is doing you a favor, and they know what they're talking about!
