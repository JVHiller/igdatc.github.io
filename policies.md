# IGDATC COVID-19 Policy

For in-person and hybrid meetings, masking and vaccination policy and enforcement will be determined by the board member(s) or volunteer(s) running the meeting, and will be communicated to attendees both here and in individual event listings.

**Twin Cities Playtest**

* Virtual-only on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/igdatc).

**MN VR + HCI**

* In-person at [REM5](https://www.rem5vr.com/).

Mask and vaccination policy: Vaccinations and/or Masks encouraged.  Please do not attend in person if you feel sick or have been exposed to COVID in the previous 5 days.

We are currently seeking venues to move our Gamedev and Playtest events to a hybrid format. We will continue holding virtual portions for all of our core events at 6:30pm every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Wednesday on our (YouTube channel)[https://www.youtube.com/user/igdatc], with chat and socializing taking place on the (IGDATC Discord server)[https://discord.igdatc.org].

Please bear with us as we transition our core events to a hybrid format. We will continue to monitor the situation, and give updates as frequently as possible. If you have any questions or concerns you want to bring to the board, please do not hesitate to email us at igdatwincities@gmail.com.
