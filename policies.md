## Code of Conduct

All IGDATC events – online and in-person – are safe spaces where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. We expect all participants to be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and online.

IGDATC believes in protecting the free and uncensored self-expression of our community members in the work that they produce, however it is the utmost priority to us that members of our community feel safe to experience the work we curate at our events and in our spaces.

To that end, IGDATC supports a safe and inclusive environment for all members of our community regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, race, physical appearance, body size, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, professional status, or religion. This commitment extends beyond our events and into social media and any other form of digital spaces affiliated with IGDATC.

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, any form of sexual harassment or assault (including unwelcome physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention), physical harassment, verbal and/or written harassment, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of an IGDATC event.

People asked to stop any of these behaviors are expected to comply immediately and, depending on the nature and severity of the behavior, may be directed to leave the event space and/or may be reported to authorities. Neither ignorance of IGDATC policy nor intoxication is an excuse for unacceptable behavior.

The IGDATC Board may take any action it deems appropriate in reaction to harassment, up to and including a ban on participation in IGDATC events and communities.

It is important to note that IGDATC board members and volunteers are equally subject to these policies and are subject to the same rules and procedures as anyone else.

When addressing complaints of harassment and assault, our first priority is to ensure the safety and privacy of everyone involved. If ever you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, or if you see someone else being treated with disrespect, contact an organizer, volunteer, or IGDATC board member.

If you feel you are in imminent danger, please seek assistance from venue security and/or local authorities immediately. Additionally, after the immediate incident has passed, the [IGDA Harassment Resources](https://igda.org/resourcelibrary/harassment/) page offers suggested guidance on safety and self-care.

We take seriously our duty to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all community members regardless of IGDA membership status.
