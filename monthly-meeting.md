The IGDATC Monthly Meetings are our “main event” and an excellent place to meet local game makers and learn new things. We generally have two presentations at each meeting covering game industry topics such as design, programming, marketing, art, audio, and everything in between. In addition to our main speaker, we have a shorter “member project” presentation that is great for first time speakers! Our events also open with announcements and an opportunity for you to pitch your latest project in front of the audience. At the end of the night, we head over to a local bar for more socializing.

### Attend Monthly Meetings

We typically meet starting at 6:00pm every month on the second Wednesday at [Nerdery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/9555+James+Ave+S+%23245/@44.8310696,-93.3005977,17z/) in the south metro. These events are free and open to the public, but require registration to attend. Check [our Eventbrite](https://igdatc.eventbrite.com/) for the latest event listings.

### Call for Speakers

Almost every topic relating to the gaming industry is welcome at our event. We are a very casual and friendly crowd. If this is your first time speaking, the 20-30 minute “member project” slot might be perfect for you! Please email us at [events@igdatc.org](mailto:events@igdatc.org) if you are interested in speaking at the IGDATC Monthly Meeting.
